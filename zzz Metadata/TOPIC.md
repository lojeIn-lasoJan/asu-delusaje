# Convos to extract from
## Convo-1 {constantscript:off-topic 2/1/2023}:
Over the span of a few decades, the Amosi tribe wiped the other 23 tribes as well as it could off the map
10 were completely killed, their blood drained into iron slabs
7 were destroyed through war, their whole male population killed
5 outlived it, 3 of them barely, the other 2 being allies of the Amosi
The map, imagine, is that on the Middle East
The Amosi originate from just around Baghdad
They singlehangedly wiped out and occupied all of Anatolia, the Levant, and Sinai in the span of 30 years, utterly and completely wiped off the map
the Amosi was, in area, the smallest tribe
but, the most powerful and richest
WB
Its big
its just that like irl, civ starts in Middle East
{what is the most powerful country}: the Taknitic Empire
the successors to the Amosi, they rule dthe dawn of humanity
because, humans started in the Middle East practically, and started spreading out late.
well, either way, the Taknitic Empire is old
Uhh, more like is the Babylonians were older and survived to modern day in age, and culturally like a Sino-Semitic Mix
6005 years ago the Taknitic empire was founded, and according to legend, the Amosi were ~2000 years old at dissolluntion.
like Hinduism in Old Orthodoxy. One God many forms
however, many breakaways formed
{i see india united. is it also a monarchy or a democracy or something else?}
An empire
break away state of the China Kingdom
Because humans, who starting spreading from there from the Middle East circa 6000 years ago, came through Iran, then India, then into China
{are monarchies more common}: Yes, due to the clan structure
Diqiwo is an old kingdom, which came from Iran and spread eastwards, so it had a lot of breakaways
{democracies}: such as Ethiopia, Anatolia, and (kinda) Cypronxh
## Convo-2 {Friends of The Schwa:conworlding 27/2/2023}:
for my world, there was like one big one, then they got trauma, so they didn't war for centuries, and genocide majorly for millenia
over 100 years, they killed 90% of all men, and 70% of all people
## Convo-3 {Friends of The Schwa:conworlding 21/3/2023}:
well, due to sociopolitics, it was a big, big, uneasy alliances of city-clanstates. poroks. they formed teh franconic leaugue, stretching from "Stockholm" to "Kent" at times, as its just a big trade agreement. then, it got invaded. they war rarely due to collective ancient trauma and society, but they are a giant ethnic and societal hotspot
but, trade is crucial, due to giant gorean migrations, which threw the balance of power very often, so they were a common binder
its a generally marshy land though. a wet, rainy, forested area, stretching to "Wales"
the Franconic Forest
Oh, Stockholm is an island that is sadder and wetter than England. also, they are not in power.
so, no, but, Finland and the rest of Sweden is cold and nice. still cold. the world is quite cold
yes. by a bit the hottest parts are only 35 C, and the coldest are -40, which are located in Northern "Canada" 
so yeah quite cold. idk by how much exactly.
## Convo-4 {Friends of The Schwa:conworlding 12/3/2023}:
Country borders, some provinces, coadt line, cities (technically in world thry barely exist), some ideas on biomes, and rivers
for my world,, its basically a copy of the shape and size of our world. but I mostly focuss of Eurasia, as thats where humans and lore started. so, Americas and Africa are very neglected
why nearly the same as irl? laziness lol
I have many cultural analogs, but I cram them in to fit so violently that they become unique.  also, to make it separate everything has reasoning, which differs from irl. like the Cypronxhians, which are in the Caucasus, have a dynasty turn around faster than china. why? because mountains, age, and history
or the similairities are only skin deep. like the Dalai, who live where the Ganges would be. they look indian, but are very different, much more similair culturally to either the chinese or Japanese culturally than to irl indians
I bet the irl areas can be easily guessed
I'm currently curious how I'll do political maps because how land ownership works in my world is complex to say the least
huh. in my world, all the land is ceremonially owned the emporer. then it shared between sees, and those sees are split into kingdoms. the ruler of the see is elected form the kings, but usually isn't predecided. then kingdoms are split into provinces, all provinces techniaclly ruled and owned by the ruler of the kingdom, and teh ruler of a kingdom is "elected" from the province rulers. the same system goes down within the povinces, then within the region, which are subdivided in clanlands, ruled by clans.
usually, when members of two differnt clans marry, lands from the calns are given to the other clan as dowry, usually from the groom's side. but usually, its joint control, or just a ceremonial handing over.
its complex.
approx 1B
NETHERLANDS IS LIKE 5 SEPARATE ISLANDS
WHY DID I DO THAT
this is the base image that AUsteran (which in world is a slave factory 游 )
oh, it {suez canal} exists, but its underground
also, the route through the Fertile Crescent river is much more popular
from a river, to a giant temple, into another big river which passes straight through a giant market and capital city, then into very rich areas, and then out of the Persian Gulf
barely, because imagine song dynasty ships instead of industrial ships
also, it rarely used
the black route is much more efficient and much more practical. its has many big rivers and cities. the red route is only used to accessthat city just north of that big rive rthere. its a big city, but also over land trade to the black route so... the red route is basciaclly obsolete
btw, most tarde is from india and china into the middle east, then from europe to the middle east, meeting up there, mostly overland becaus eits much faster. or by train
## Convo-5 {Friends of The Schwa:conworlding 11/3/2023}:
ok. if humans start spread around 30,000 bGe, that means the population rises from the meager hundreds to like a few tens of thousands. They would spread north
all language families would start then. circa 28,000-20,000 bGe.
no. There are plans for it to be the first script language, so it has ancestors, so it way later. around 11,000 bGe maybe. very old
o, modern day is 6005 pGe. thats 36,005 years ago. each year is 360 earth days. so shorter, but old
ok. do you want continous use of the script until today? I can permit that via the Pawani conservatism
The ancient Koic petroglyphs of c. 12,500 bGe become a syllabary, and get semi-standardised c. 11,000 bGe. It slowly become the lhejwar script, which is kept standard by the Classical Koani from 1,000 bGe to 1,000 pGe. during that time is splinters, and becomes the many Pawani scripts
## Convo-6 {Friends of The Schwa:conworlding 9/3/2023}:
I have a very unique culture, the Pawani. They live in an asteroid like belt, living a nomadic, hunter gatherer lifestyle, very communal, very very old, where they live is very desolate and sparse. What sorts of creation myths could they have?
They have no sun. The comet band is over like a giant area (technically its a sphere) and on the edge are stars, and within in the sphere are stars, which have other planets.
Yes. Floating in the great cold winds. Like 40 mph, 5춿C winds. The asteroids are very sparse and usually icy or mostly desolate
They hunt the few animals and plants on the asteroids that exist. But, there are  enough asteroids, and depth
Hunter gathering is mostly extinct tbh, but they are very nomadic and collectivist
They use big ships, made of wessen leaves. Wessen is a very very very hardy grain. Theres also many species that are native there, such as Creperids and Enedri, large musclous lanky animals that travel and hunt much smaller animals. Kinda like filter feeders
Yes. Its like a desert. But cold and windy. Things such as small insexts can suspend
They mostly use larger asteroids to plant wessen, but wessen is very common. then gather it, and hunt some larger animals for meats. It seems desolate, but can develop complex ish ecosystems
Yes. They come from irl a small pocket near a ""river"", the ships came around and spread from a few hundred yo a few thousand
Just because they could irl.  Maybe to find others
Isolation is very important to them. They need eachother, so Isolation is a death sentence

A summary of the History of the Harab Valley, before the Century of Tribal Collapse: approx. 1400 bGc agriculture is started by many city states across teh Rivers, unifying the tribes. approx 1000 bGc writign emerges, originally logographic, but many smart people make phonetic ones. Some sort of collapse was around 600 bGc, causing many mass migrations, settling the Khaney tribe, etc. Then, the Amosi tribe started to gain much more power due to power over grain and rice. Thus, the nationalistic and supremacist tendencies caused teh Century of Tribal Collapse.

Please ask for context if needed
## Convo-7 {Friends of The Schwa:conworlding 11/3/2023}:
ah nice. for my world the year is 360 days long, and exactly 24 hours
partially to ease me, and them with calendars
they have prayer beads with 8640 beads, one for each hour of the year
and they have basically smaller coils of 12, to keep track of the duodecimally counted cycles of years.
There are many traditions from the Harabban Empire (or is it Taknitic? eh. doesn't matter) which are older than the Clan reforms. Like the duodecimal numerology. It was used for years, land plots and timetelling
after the clan reforms most things became decimal, but those things stayed base-12. 
The Century of Tribal Collapse affects stuff again.
they... honestly don't care. the priests have week long mantras too
they deal with excessively long practices. it is to practice the eternity and completely of their gods
but, during mass migrations, quite a few of the original mantras were lost completely, the Mantra of The Poor, The Eternal Tradition(very ironic), and teh Mantra of the 600 tribes
The mantra of the poor: a collection of every possible way to die if poor and destitute

The eternal tradition: a giant portmanteau of every word and name possible. All names had to be in the eternal tradition; after its loss there was... A hig religious decable

The mantra of the 600 tribes: a genealogy
## Convo-8 {Friends of The Schwa:conworlding 4/3/2023}:
The Noumeidi-the only hunter-gatherers of Oreidica. The Noumeidi developed hunter-gathering, via isolation in the deep cold forests of Noumeidi, ~4000-4500, when the temperature was much colder. they developed fire magic to combat the harsh cold, and many rituals to fight it. many have been 'civilised' by the northern Nousse Kingdom, many taking the clan name Noumeidertys 'the opposers of the Noumeidi'.
## Convo-9 {Friends of The Schwa:conworlding /3/2023}:
for my world, it does slightly. because souls exist, and they basically have two options: reincarnation or bliss via meeting thee goddess of death. its chosen based on morals and beliefs. but, if also a slight law: if a soulless object is treated by souls as revered, it will become slightly revered
souled object can have the same effect, but its much slighter
your body can't be without your soul. if do that, congrats, you get an unkillable zombie
the soul is preservatory force, without it, your body is likea piece of meat.
and, aging is just your soul detaching
sudden death is when the body is beyond repair, so the soul can't do anything, so just, Vanatyza Jyza I guess
like car crash
Vanatyza Jyza is a common exclamation. Good death, referiing to the goddess of death
so, like, back pain is just your back becoming souless
now, souls can exit bodies for short periods of time, when in some deep prayer or meeditation. so, iff you are killed then, your body is dead, but your sould is till attached. however, you can't die twice, so... immortality
the men of cloth? they were something to fight.
usually to continue the connection to the body and soul, the body was chopped into many protected pieces, then connecte dot wire like machine of wooden spires, covered in fireproof, softened silks. They were unkilleable during the Hanoi War, of after the Hanoi Kingdom was plunged into the sea
## Convo-10 {Your Average CA-27 Avon Sabre 9/3/2023}:
adoption wasn't a thing back then. I am thinking of assimiliatory migration
like many lucans fled to the Amosi, the ancestors of Gana and Owe Mi being them.
as a summary of the History of the Harab Valley: approx. 1400 bGc agriculture is started by many city states across teh Rivers, unifying the tribes. approx 1000 bGc writign emerges, originally logographic, but many smart people make phonetic ones. Some sort of collapse was around 600 bGc, causing many mass migrations, settling the Khaney tribe, etc. Then, the Amosi tribe started to gain much more power due to power over grain and rice. Thus, the nationalistic and supremacist tendencies caused teh Century of Tribal Collapse.
nope. the logography was made to fit a very specific analytic language family. that didn't work for otehr language families. they weer in contact with other languages and scripts, so they made them. its like trying to smash nuhalk into hanzi
ah. well then, they made new scripts as the logographies didn't work
and the logography itself fell out of favour due to clunkiness and difficulty
## Convo-11 {Your Average CA-27 Avon Sabre 21/12/2023}:
It is BIG big. like, that language I showed, it has a whole dramatic backstory, golden age, and fall
the Samarians are the few survivors of a pan-ethnic genocide
they huddled with the Ponts in the small Liao lands, and stayed unidentified for a hundred years, were obscure from the Empire for another 400, until the Atlasic people of North Irquii started to migrate northwards, when a king, D친콑c콠nt칲jo 칀풪sam칢r칲拷꼋칬/Dash the Samar, led then into Old Goisi.
irquii is named after Iroquwa the Iron, who wa sthe king that restarted the Golden Age of the Taknitic Empire
it is the name of the heart of the Taknitic League
but, more historically, the Santerranese.
They took over all of Europe successfully.
they had colonies from Iceland to Tajikistan
they were the napoleon
according to them, North America is geographically europe
yes
the have no pacific
so, peopel came from the north, from Europe, or Thyaria, as they call it
only, people there live long
the average is 150 years
for example, Laoz, is the oldest person..  he is ~5500 years old
he is the second hand source for everything
when I say everything
I mean everything
he met people who lived during the reign of king Dayan, who lived only 300 years after the first legendary person in the world
a small summary though: The first people with accurate records for are the 24 tribes, whoi lived ~200 bGc. Then big genocide by the Amosi. It was tragic. I can give the story of one tribe, but it's a horror beyond words. Then, Takunti the Godly and his demi-goddess wife created the Taknitic empire. Writing, law, and language were standardised. after Takunti I's death, the survivors of the Genocide showed up in the far north.
Then, the golden age of Takunti I fell, the last major contribution being industrialisation.
Stuff, occured for 300 years, when a great-grandson of an emporer declared the second country ever in the north, the Cypronxhians. It, occurs. Then, 100 after that, a golden age, mass migration, a distant ethnic dies out due to too much oxygen(long story). Laoz and Goisi are born. Thwe south unifies, the survivors are pushed into said south, and Goisi and the survivors, called the Pont-Samari, travel into the south of the south. another empire, the DAo empire, pushes into India, and the Cypronxhians first push into Europe.
thats the first 600 out of the 6000 years
theres just too much
## Convo-12 {Your Average CA-27 Avon Sabre 22/12/2023}:
the bank {where the blood steel} is in the most impregnable palace, period. to steal it, you would: a. have to commit sacrilege. b. disrespect an armies of gods. c. get past the most armed area in the continent
they have near zero secularisation, so...
also, you are worried about the 6000 year old iron, while there's checks notes 60 kilotonnes of heliang(a precious metal), the second biggest library and resarch facility, the imperial royal family, first edition copies of sacred texts, and the centre of nearly everything. within an area of a few hundred thousand
you have misplaced worries on this
the atomic structure of this world is incomplete. It would be practically very difficult to do.
however, the atomic structure does permit magic
basically, its based on control of energy via your soul
other controls of energy are physics
## Convo-13 {Your Average CA-27 Avon Sabre 21/1/2023}:
Yep. also a small but crucial bit of revision on the decimation of the tribes. one basically ilked by, and thrived afterwards, strating the second proper war since the genocide, over 700 years afterwards
For Gh. tribe, the small african area survived
Oh thats the 25th tribe. Its.... strange
it migrated from Pn and Sm five hundred years before
becoming high mountain body modifiers
and falling to their death is the valley tot the north
high and mountain are separate adjectives
## Convo-14 {Your Average CA-27 Avon Sabre 23/1/2023}:
yep. Basically, slave can only be: children or granddchildren of slaves or b. Keremelohans 游
Keremeloha is basically Central Asia
and due to that, East Ghatye started importing and breeding the best slaves, but also intermarried, making basically enslaved natives
called the Dala slaves
now, because it got them fabulously rich, they decided to use the empty, lush, new island nearby(Australia) to send slaves from all around, to make a slave factory
and a ginormous church
which they were the priessts of
Also some Dala slaves were chucked into Alaska, forming the second black ethnicity
because indonesia was just starting to be. It barely needed slaves
slaves were used for building and ships
So it didn't have any native slaves
Also, it was a giant warzone
Slaves were being deported back into Keremeloha willingly
Because an empire from the east blasted on the scene, freed the slaves, intermarried, and then invaded into Keremeloha, dropped them off, and created the Greater Gosans
thus, mechanism was necessary in Diqiwo and Goisi, so the industrial revolution started in 4800, but slowly and mostly in Goisi, because Diqiwo got them cheap slaves(like a galley for 300 ish pounds) 
a galley is 50 people
6 pounds a person
but, prices vary depending on origin
but, they all share in common: their language, culture, and some Keremelohan ancestry
imagine your small duchy bringing in 5000 slaves for only 30,000 pounds
## Convo-15 {Your Average CA-27 Avon Sabre 3/2/2023}:
Transcarpathorusyn/polabian mix
south africa, 3454
like the central bottom by the big river mouth
the people found out that pigs exist around 3444
then they made pork
and pork was a very influential thing in their cultrur
and their cuisine is based on pork based dishes, marination and sauce sbeing used
Plebian

best part: due to how civilisation works there, noones poor, so not lowerc class
its based a strange system of clan based trade and subsistence
due to a war somewhere else, radio was invented, so now they can sell better
everythings an ad
because there are clans which own certain areas around them, on which most farm and herd. Then they trade in the ginormous clanhouse halls. then trains, footpaths, and magic paths connect clanhouses
clans are ran by family, so it might seems to objectify women, but no, it objectifies everyone
"once you old enough to pick rice, you go to the fields"
or hold a sign
thats a job that kids mostly do
everythings rice
meat depends on where you live
dragon meat is mainland chinese food for example
while the richest areas eat duck
duck as it links the river, land and sun
but as it flies rarely, its cooked. so a cooked (smoked too) duck is very symbolic and holy
meanwhile some guy is just screaming poetry at his radio
## Convo-16 {Your Average CA-27 Avon Sabre 8/2/2023}:
in my world, the Hanoi people just are everywhere the come from the prosperous Song area, and then exploded out into Arabia, and off from there
like just they are literally 20% of the world population. thats not a lot in just number, but the world is sprcely populated so
they are populous
they spread via religion, and few are pur Hanoi. becasue they were Hanoi, spread into Arabia, and mixed. then they spread out further
like Arabs. if they started in South China and then travelled into Arabia
Like, the Hanoi people are native to Song, basically South China. then a prophet brought them to Arabia via India. many stayed across the migration, and many grew and mixed into the Arabian population. then, they spread out via proselatysation
## Convo-17 {Your Average CA-27 Avon Sabre 24/2/2023}:
also, in my world, the guy that ochestrated the genocide of the Khaney, King Ejawi, his son-in-law was a khaney prince.
so, much irony. that prince was the brother of the last khaney king.
mind you, all khaney clanmembers outside of marriage sto royal family were rounded up, then enslaved, tortured, and then drained of blood to make whips with which they were whipped. the spoiler is there for a reason btw
exactly
so yeah.... a similair process was carried out on other tribes. except the Ban tribe. their island just exploded
more like a gas leak, then a match being struck and the island was shattered, covered itself and surrounding areas in a hard, white, marble like stone, killing every banite. oh, and every single one, because it happened during a banite holiday

my world has only rice
no barley
no wheat
true
I am trying to make outlandish things out of rice, but east asia already beat me
rice paper? rice stew? rice ink? done already
also, my dog eats lots of rice too
also, if you white rice, then indians brown rice
Also, with that khaney prince marrying into the royal family, that means that the future kings are ethnically part of an ethnivity they exterminated
like the fuhrers being part jewish
yes.  the right part is the khaney part, the right line being the emporers, and the circled guy being the exterminator. they are more closely connected by a different marriage though
your reaction is correct
mind you, all the kings there were part of the xtermination, but just of different ethnicities. like the the emporer at the bottom exterminated the Gahana, while being 1/64th Gahana himself
## Convo-18 {Your Average CA-27 Avon Sabre 4/3/2023}:
In Asu Delusaye(my fictional World) theres an ancient dynasty of the Taknitids. They trace over 6000 years back, in power for nearly all of those years
They could in theory, by legend, trace 2000 years further back
from Dasa to Takunuti LXXXIX
so yeah. much power
maybe like 5 {years out of power}
so yeah. very very poerful
and big
## Convo-19 {Your Average CA-27 Avon Sabre 17/3/2023}:
the oldest evidence of modern humanity in my world is a 53,000 yo stone post. It is a grave that was lost in a storm.
Its old. there are older settlements, but they are of a slightly different species, which are ~300,000 yo
my world has a messed up biohistory
Homo Australodomus
Ethiopia to Georgia
but, a closely related species did get to Australia
its called Homo Sapiens
but, Anatolia has tons of human evidence. from thousands of mounds and skeletons, to being the urheimat to possibly every extant language family and origin of modern humans.
they didn't get into Europe.
because of the Gorgonids.
they didn't go north because cold and sea and nope. they didn't go east becasue mountain, and south because plague
so they stayed in the middle east.
ok. well, due to that, humans stayed tucked into the Middle east (mostly) until a much of land reforms 5500 years ago, allowing long term migrations.
and from 10,000-5000, a weather shift occured, making the gorgonids go basically extinct, warming the steppes up, and increasing the floodplains of Middle eastern rivers
thus, the population and civilisation exploded, so migration was possible and necessary
## Convo-20 {Your Average CA-27 Avon Sabre 20/3/2023}:
for my world: there are 3 holidays which are consistent, because the calendar is so obvious that to not is dumb. 360 days per year, moons goes around every 20 and 30 days.
## Convo-21 {Your Average CA-27 Avon Sabre 1/4/2023}:
I am thinking: because their symbolic generation is 24 years, their creation year would be 3,590 bGc, 150 generations from the  Galilee battle. They have an oral tradition of Dash and his kin, so that would play in. maybe 1790 bGc, 75 generations ago. before that they could say that the generations were longer, or, as their historians would guess, the ages were counted in lumar months or seasons.
so instead of a generation being 280, or 100 years, it would mean 23, or 25 years
## Convo-22 {Friends of The Schwa:conworlding 18/4/2023}:
the centre four-spoked thing, the Ziti쬬habbahi, represents the four stages/parts
when applied temporally, starting from the whole rectangle ant-clockwise, its summer/noon/peak, autumn/dusk/decline, winter/midnight/fall, spring/dawn/rise
and, the part at the top represets the main aspect
then, their a golden sun. thats the smaller circle at the bottom. that cycles around, and represents the minor aspect. the day and the year.
the aspect it applies to is what aspect it would be at if peak is at top.
many Anuziti쬬habbahi would have multiple suns, spinning around to show all the possible cycles.
it should be like a tiered thig with layers and pawns and spinning layers etc.
this is the original thing. the gold square is like a pawn, moving across, and the inner four-pronged thing is meant to be able to spin
{image-1}
yes.
it has a similair origin (the inenr thing) to the swastika
its become a symbol of a lot of stuff.
persevence, fate, eternity, cycle, the year, the year, the soul, earth, universe, the Asi캖an people(the people who first created it), history, time
its on the front cover, or at least hidden in the design) of every history book
basically, originally the centre symbol of four prongs evolved, of cycle, 4 stages etc.
then, some culture decided to use a stamp to keep track of how many cycles it was, as it was used as a glorified calendar}
the spinny thing is just a fancy calendar thing tbh.
it is imagined as cycling. going around and around. imagine seeing a picture of a water wheel as an example. it isn't spinning. but we think of it as spinning
it has one use as a calendar. not exclusively. its also used as a clockface,
looking at a symbol of eternity and be like "oh, Its death o'clock, not dying o'clock"
(thats legit how hours are named. 8 hours named after stages of life. warning: some cultures. not all. many ahve 24 hours)
## Convo-23 {Ailurr 11/6/2023}:
My peoples were expelled so much they became the natives of unknown lands
The Wy /w톛/
Rather, Wythyza /w톛풪퉝톛za/
As thats the nom sg
So we start with the 24Tribes. It was the tribes living across central Kladark. They were all patrilineal tribes, and nearly all fully genocided to extinction except 3 wholly (the perpetrator, the bystander(not really but pretty much), the unknown 25th tribe) (basically everyone lived in central Kladark, people hadn't yet really migrated further out)
And 5 survived, in total 1000 survived, in part. Also a but ton of widows left. The hid with Lyao코 permission in Lyao코 land, the "bystanders" land for ~500, as in other parts of the new empire, they were kill on sight.
Now, that ended with emperor Iroquwa, who stripped laws against them at last, and remade land laws. The Lyao코 lands were in the north of the empire. One of Iroquwa s sons, 룚isi, gained some land in the south. A war started there, and the refugees settled in his lamd, and he became their king. Due to land laws, migration could happen, so some people, who were super nationalist, here heading to the chunk of land for the survivors, so they fled south into 룚isis lamd, a peaceful refuge.
Goisil, the name of  that land, was a buffer state. It got involved in giant wars, and got pushed into the edge of the known world. The mix of all the people who lived in Goisil became the Wy people, Wy literally being an archwic world for people
Imagine like a nation called the Fulk people
Then, thsy got pushed into the sea, into unknown lands, as they were involved back in the war.
Theres more detail i could give, but will give later

so, the war that started it was also caused by the genocide of the 24 tribes. the Ghnna tribe of the far south had a colony on the other side of the Red sea (from now on, I will use irl place names as the map is pretty much the same), and the colony there survived the genocide, whil ethe main didn't
so, the Alexandrians (the colony) wanted back the land. which was the south of the Empire, so they invaded after 700 years, and the Gosans joined as they were sent douth into south Arabia as settlers and documenters, from their northerner homeland. they wanted to be an indipendent nation, so they joined. then the invasion of all Arabia was beaten back later, and the coast was left. the Gosans got the far bits of Oman, by Iran. they became an indipendent nation, and were blamed because they could have in theory stopped it. thus they were stomped off, and were forced to flee across the Arabian sea to south India. some stayed and became the West Gosans, and became a diaspora.
the East Gosans, the Wy, kept on colonising East until South China, and made their new homeland Guam. they got into conflict with other peoples on the mainland themselves migrsting
## Convo-24 {Ailurr 14/6/2023}:
I have a monastic state that exists purwely out of religion
very isolationist
its a small archipelago in the middle of the caspian sea. it is just purely monastries, and it has the most divergent genetics
it has been pretty much isolated for 17k years.
its because they see their land made for them especially, fished out by their founders, and thats their explanation for the monastic life. its holy land, so worship the 120 spirits/gods
theres a famous line from them: "only natives ever set touch on only this land"
~17k years ago, humans arrived on Qaradash, set up settlements of some kind, and then existed quite isolated because of distance. it wasn't organised. it was just humans settling there, then due to isolation, and exceptionalism, religion grew
well, they have only been really isolated for 10k
thats because humanity had civilisation and culture properly for that long
6kya, humans hit a civ goal. they united as one. they had writing, language, farming etc.
and Qaradash is generally chilling in the corner, living by itself "hey want to join us" "what do i get" "protection, resources" "ok ig(they dont need it the monks are warriors too)"
and they also are sustainable
qaradash is an archipelago
in the sea
and humans came from just iver the sea
humans have lived in space, and there are other planets, but qaradash is just a small, ~2.5km2 archipelago
btw, space is somehow human hospitable
so: the universe is finite
its a big sphere, at whichs end matter and energy are one
yep. none of the worlds scientists know how the universe hasn't collapsed
so, there is air and comets looped around the universe, includiing above the edge
you think there isn't [magic]? yes, but that wouldnt comply with how magic works. no one exactly knows how it isn't collapsing. it just isn't
so, the edge is called the pawan, and theres a thriving ecosystem there
magic is a form of very slightly sentient energy particles
nah, i'll just leave it: "noone knows how, but it is"
so yeah, humans live on the edge because its hospitable enough.
theres water, regions naturally sensible for humans, air,land

where, the nothing is eventually used as something
like, theres chaos/nothing, and then it becoming the jade boc of the universe or soomething lik ethat
thats a creation myth i made
god just strted toe xist, used the nothing to make a giant jade box(of specified size), the jade dust inside became devils and daemons and creatures of all kinds, until one very evil one ate the rest and filled thew box. then god cut up the moster(akominawatepa), and created 12 universes out of the box and the monster
he just... did at one point. no one really questioned it, as god is just a big spirit, and spirits just appear sometimes and dissapaer, as they come from magic randomly clumping up
but god does exist
well "god"
his name is Lawo
it is partially true, the universe is a giant box that was created out of nothing
he is a big spirit
he was formed one day, probs 9kya, and just is going with it because... he doesn't know better
he gains power from it tho
as how spirits and magic works with willpower
humans and spirits are very very diffrent
spirits are sentient balls of energy
if lawo created the world
then the world is younger than him
or some form of him did. he gains power from people thinking he did. they all now know he didn't due to some funky archeology
he still is as powerful as he is tied in with so many religions
people have slight orc power on magic. their collective willpower and strengthen it, decrease it, destroy or create it.
if people thought lawo was powerful, he becanme more powerful
honestly, most religions cant self-reinforce that hard, as it depends on how much I wnat it to

the Anatolic Atlasids that replaced them will a few centuries later be invaded by another Atlasic group, same branch even, from the east
because the anatolic peoples spread into the Lohanic lands, some in the anatolic branch across the coast. then, via colonialism, further down and by the coast, untill they get all around the caspian sea. then they invade from there
anatolis got ethnically swapped a lot
migration is a big part of my world

The 12fold
Basically they split literally everything and anything into 12ths. Their second is literally 1/12^7 of a year. They have twelve months, 12 hours, and 12 great gods, etc.
They love their 12s
But they currently use denary (base 10)
Except for like a third of the world
Except like a third of the world, that actually uses base 12
[how long is a 12^7th of a year btw?]
125/144s
360 days to the dot
The day is 24 hours to the dot
The astronomy is already wack, idc at all
Like, remember the universe being finite thing?
Yeah. Then theres the imperial years
Basically, a society in a cycle of rise, peak, decline, collapse. Those are the imperial seasons, 36(3칑12) years. There are four seasons a year, 144 years is an imperial year.
Like 36 usually per rise, per peak, per decline, and per fall

i could... [take the idea of limited free speech against teh gods on the solstices]
off to rex-r
long story, stupid name
its [rex-r] the other world in the universe i have

like, they have defined second, 12 second periods, 144 second periods, etc, until a full year. they use that using designs
a day is not a full unit in 12 fold actually
theres 2.5 days, and 5 hours, but no 1 day
4,9,7,2,4.8 so rational but bad
ohoho. another use of 12 fold. they use 12 fold for literally anything
they also use 12 fold for body parts

Yeah. Gods are spirits are the same, just power difference. And humans might be spirits bound to bodies in their myths
life is just bound spirits then

A cool conlang thing i did:
> There exists a group of species called the monkey tree, and some form wood like balls, called in world *ka콑tan* /ka톗.tan/.
> This named is technically a loan of polish kasztan, conker.
> In world, ka콑tan as meaning that natural ball comes from their use as a name for a type of ball toy, too ka콑tan.
> The ka콑tan toy was first made in the city of Ka콑tan, which is from Kasatano, the cities original name, via evolution.
> Kasatano is a combination of 'ka' fort, and 'tano', a species of tree.
> Kasatano was built on a hill with a small forest of Tano trees

qaradash being my main example
its the monk archipelago
they are 1. smol. like its a small archipelago, only like a thousadn people live on it.
2. very isolationist
like, they dont like outside interaction
they dont need it
they are also the ship building capital of the world
because they can easily work wood and magic, they can build big deepwater ships fast
animistic
they believe in 120 gods, all who created and rule the world
wdym? each has a temple, they have a head monastry keeping oral records, and they have books of their myths
however, the qaradash isles are an environmental sanctuary
the assigned half the islands to be untouched and remain wooded
and the great red ibau콑an, an ibis like bird, has its main breeding ground in qaradash
the red ibau콑an is seen as a symbol of the cypronxh imperium, so the survival of qaradash is seen as essential for their remained symbolism
and qaradash people are the most genetically divergent
they have been separated for pretty much ten thousand years
and they speak an isolate language
no known relatives
its not even theorised to be related to anything else
its that old and different
its like if a tonal polysynthetic isolate was in europe.
to give an example of the sheer difference
no one would think they would be related to IE
its old and unique
most similair to the pawani languages, yet the phenotypic difference prove unrelated ness
pawani languages are space languages
spoken no where near
it also was raided once by people from the other side of the earth
the sedites lived deep in the south, when the known world wasvery small, and they cam out of their homeland fast
and some raiders came to the far north, where qaradash is
the qaradashis quickly defeated them tho
the sedites were desert raiders fighting an island of monks in the middle of the sea after all
ye. the qaradashis have it as a wierd stint in their history
for most of it, they wre illiterate
well, "most" is an exageration
they became a thing really around 4000 bGc. they were made literate in 200 pGc, 4200 soemthing years into their existance.
not connected to Qaradash tho
so, they adopted a script that works for their language, that was popular once. then those ethnicities' languages went extinct, so they stopped using the script, making qaradash the scripts last user

## Convo-29 {Ailurr 6/7/23}
it was that genocide started by the imperial cult nazi culture (taknitic)
ethnic supremacy and  search for power
they were the smallest tribe
they tried {to stop them}
they failed fantastically
so, the first phase was them going into the woods at the end of the world to kill a tribe. no one cared, too small, too irrelevant. then, they kept on occupying and conquering the other nearby tribes, and farming. they got rich enough from the sheer amounts of rice, that anyone that tried getting across the gant wall they built could just be payed off. so they got now a giant, fertile peninsula to themselves. so then they chilled for a few decades. the whole peninsula was wiped out from people.
so, they became big and powerful, and rich too
then their sheer ruchness caused a famine and shortage of rice due to complex stuff. but they had a backup grain. thus, the others starved, and shrank, so more of their land, but the amosi were growing, so when the famine stopped, their opponents were small and dependent
you are one of the first, if not the first, to learn of how it actually worked and caused so much destruction
it is brutal af.
no, im not rooting for them. its just that its a past i had to have made for the future i have already made to make sense
not exactly succesful. they wanted absolute cultural hegemony, and that didnt actually happen. survivors existed. many.
yes, but their goal was 100%. also, they wanted to be the only tribe. 2 other were knowingly left, 3 others unknowingly
its a lot when they had the whole world at their disposal to kill them
also, the widows republics
also, there is nothing i am diredctly shielding them from
they literally just survive by numbers and tactic.
when the world is the size of teh middle east it is at least feasible
at that time, only the middle east was inhabited
the tribe that was in "africa" and the one in "europe" usrvived
tru. but also, it is one chapter, small in time relatively. the world extends over thousands of years, and it happens within 1 century 
the comparison of a book where the character only gets raped is incorrect thusly
it is a lot. but currently, with what i have built upon the fact it has happened, just... how to tame it down i dont know how
i have pretty much that one conworld
as said, i have no clue how to now change it, considering everything thats based on it

also its speakers live in the mst inhospitable part of my conworld
they live in an asteroid belt pretty much
it isnt even post modern tech
nobody is sure how humans got there, but they got there
ships
also it isnt a vacuum
its just cold winds

pretty much, the universe is a big sphere, surrounded by a wall of pure magic, that rips energy, magic, and matter into one
and on the edge, which itself, the wall, is very hot, is an asteroid like belt, covered in water, asteroids, and wind. teher also exist stars on the edge itself, that are just founts of magic. some produce dust that ebcomes the asteroids
that is the pawan
thats where the dshari koans live, the people that originally spoke xd
so ye. very inhospitable
there also exist "stars" floating in the asteroid belt. that are fusing stuff
thats actually what all asteroids are made of, but that will take us a few billion years back

And a monogametal throws out the other chromosome its paired with for reproduction before it occurs
Making sure the whole chromosome gets passed down, and all children do the same
Thus, within a population, that gene spreads fast
But, they can't successfully reproduce with eachother
Thus all if them die off there
You see where its going?
Extinction
Ut has to do with how they do it
Pretty much, they would need 4 chromosomes in total to reproduce
Properly
Monogametal+ normal is 3 chromosomes then, not that many problems with it, but kinda parasitic with the results
But 2 would fail completely
Like benefits off of
It benefits off of it being non-monogametal
And thus fully passes on its whole genome
Pretty much:
Normally all the genes are mixed together to get many descendants in three steps. Mixing, swapping, mixing 2.
So all descendants get unique mix of genes
But, monogametal cells in step 1, mixing, throw out their other gene
Thus they end up with 1 chromosome when swapping
Its complex
But pretty much, they make sure that their genes get passed down all descendants
Thus, mess happens when two do that
So ye
Bc that gene spreads fast it causes the mess to consonantly happen
Thus no more seeds
Thus extinction

i am thinking of the Amosi Kingdom (the genocide one) and im thinking of like how it works. im getting lots of insp from the Fire Kingdom in ATLA
bc: the culture esp the higher up is very family oreinetd. so one king decided: ykw? screw it. we have like a ton of money. lots of people. a few vassals. lets go kill the anatols.
the advisors: eh, ok
the main advisor(100 years work experience already): not a good idea tbh
king: ok. lets see
[[genocide phase 1 starts]]
meanwhile the populus is generally angry at the war and colonisation bit bc relocation and war.
some rebel and protest, but they acnt rly do anything yet
so its now more realistic
and future kings did what the first king did bc: well it was what my father did, and i should carry on his legacy
some kings were like: i think we should stop. so they did stop the killing
it was like a 40yr truce
then a later king was like: ykw? just like my gggdad, imma kill them. theres not many left (a 1/3 of the populated world)
and then he did it 
honestly, bc i am palnning for disabled kings, i feel here that king could have like narcissism or something like that
or just be not nice

q: is gxnna land a good place?
depends
mostly its a desert
i would guess like, they have extended family units and tribal society
they focus great care on raising children, but also predestined roles
theyd guilt you into doing them
asian parent style
but thats like the genocidal period (they lived during the genocide time period)
in the later periods: rice
they still have a tribal and class based society, but like the classes are looser
and evryone farms rice 
like they have: ruler, merchant, soldier. those are the main classes
and they arent exactly scrict about it later on. they just expect you to do your class' profession and like main source or career
and: they are tribal
a tribal feud could connect a lot of people
or tribal connections
so: gxnna has like a rigid society earlier on
alos, within a tribe, people have roles
based on relation
and based on age and relation they are diff roles in the tribe
like elders
so, back to gxnna, youths are often sent out, i.e. to get partners, find jobs, make relations with other tribes, to sell stuff, etc.
and widower, widow, or spinsters usually do religion
indipendent of class
but that more in early society
so when theyd be speaking the dialect im showing off
meanwhile later on, when they mostly lose nucleic consoants, they are more flexible, and they live by rivers in giant farming islands
bc they live in a nile style river
and they build like hills with fortifications on top, on which they live. but then a most forms. perfect for irrigation and farming
the live in one of the 5 great rivers.
the 1st great river is used by the Harabban empire
ye, that was part of the name insp
the root is Harab. Harappa+Arab
then the descendnat of the thnicity is the Hakada ethnicity
Harab+Akkad

monkey tree
thats the name
bc it can move its branches
so, there was like a dum underwater animal
it was like a fin
filter feeder, water went through, and it took food from it
then it developed like tiny spikes on it arms/baleens to catch larger chunks of food. they figured out how to eat via those spikes
later, it delevoped to live on land bc the sea in which it lived in was drying up
so thats how
its more complex than that, but ye
i think i made a more substantial entry on it somehwere
found it
the monkey tree is an animal.
it has splindly arms, each with smaller arms, with smaller "arms", with even smaller extensions, covered in tiny cerations, that shred whatever its trying to eat. it pumps out small amount of acid and toxins. each tooth a small amount of it, but enought to slowly eat it. also their cells are mostly cellulose, so they hold up. Those arms can move around the prey, thus the name. they look like trees, but move their arms like monkey's tails.

the very tips of their "arms" produce tiny pollen, which can spread. they can also collect it, hermaphrodity. once it is collected, they merge, the merged cell multiplies, a bunch of mixing happens with the two pairs of chrosomes in individual cells, and a process starts to occur.
the "arms" curves around those cells, becomes cellulose and proteins, pretty wood like, and then grows as such around it. thus a tough and rich surrounding. then the ball grows until it is big. it can have millions of those tiny cells. That ball is called a ka콑tan.
the tiny cells compete, and one comes out on top, then eats the surrounding cellulose, and grows into another monkey tree.

monkey trees usually settle on and solid surface they can get to, but can transport themselves. The arms are barren. they only store some water and the cellulose, for support and backup sugar. on their "roots" (arms that hold onto the surface) form tough materials, that attach to the surface, and to the roots. this is where they store their nutrients. these are called wades. these are fundamentally what the ka콑tan is made of, but less dense and nutrient rich.
the arms bit works like stinging nettles btw not shredders
And its going extinct via genetic quirks
Its also complicated, i tried explaining alr but failed, but ye. Its killing itself in oreidica
Pretty much a gene in hijacking reproduction, so that only offspring with it get madr
But when both parents have that gene, they can't have any
But bc the gene spreads fast, it causes extinction
But in rexr they are thriving
So ye
They are used as trash collection
Bc itll eat anything and then make useable sugar

They have very large doors and windows
And very curvy
The rooms are boxy ish, and arranged in wide, not that tall shapes
Except one spire
Now, they experience harsh winters, summers, and lota of rain
So they can close the windows
And the rooms insulate
The location is japanesque, but the weather is inspired off of the uk rn
But mountainous
So: bc of that, they have water systems in the walls and floors
That cool or heat the buildings
And the spire stores the water
But, it lifts water up in the summer
In the winter, the waters weight down is used for energy
But the rain and more water
So more energy than was put in

You remember the yodo script?

So ye
I made it no longer featural

Now they are descended from logograms
The script is the same in use
Now g which looks like 톖 comes from ki, baton
b, which looks like c now comes from fish

its connected to nearly all other scripts
except one that hasnt been decoded yet
bc its very very old
it was found in some recently found ruins in the mountains
they found full on abandoned castles, settlements, temples, all frozen over in the mountains. and on tablest and walls, they found a script
and some people say its actually a very old proto of one of the main language families
its like the mycenean age in greece

i should make my conworlds pantheon
Yes
I should make the pawanic pantheon
Wdym?
Theyd think its real af
In conworld... Its complex
Depends. Basically, if enough people believe in an items property, it gains thst property proportionate to the belief.
Same goes for spirits. Which can take the form of gods.

If people think a certain god exists, it forms
So: the gods exist in a way
But contradictory ideas cancel eachother. So no Yahweh appearing.

Ok so i should make the gods. I feel the primordial god would be the god of fire, sitting in the great star
Yep
So : fire god
What is the etymology of his name
Id guess hes a star (not human shaped
Or she rather
She is a star
Like a flame
Its not a metaphorical flame
Its like the believe that theres a literal star/fire thats the primordial god
I feel that the name would originate from PK. And be just 'star'
I guess she blorts out a few other primordials
Water, Meteors, Night
So: night is probs like consort to the flame mother.
But then night dies
Bc empty night
But how to connect the Meteors into the story
Maybe night and flame had a child who was the first meteors, the planets and beasts of the world
No the children are the first meteors
Not all of them
And then night dies. And from him come death.
and from death comes like knowledge and other abstract concepts
then the meteors become like attendants of flame, who forms like a whole court of them. but once they become old, they die, become dust then (enetering actual physics and astronomy), it gets spewed from the star and becomes "reborn" aka other asteroids.
and each asteroid represents something
theres an asteroid god for everything
theres an asteroid of sandal straps. theres an asteroid of the further knuckle of the ring finger on the left hand of some guy that died centuries ago.
theres everything
but they are less like gods and more like tiny animate rocks
so ye
and then once they die, they get replaced and sent out into dust
they say that theres an ulupoti of ulupoti of attendants to flame. an ulupoti is 10^~1000,000
so they bc theres an asteroids for everything past future and present
the total of gods is: 10^10^10^~6
thats massive
thats more gods than atoms
do you think that people believe in every. single. one. of. the. gods.
so... thats an impossible question
bc actual godds are just beefed up spirits
spirits are just clump of magic
magic is volatile
it can clump up and break down in literal milliseconds 
so ye. the universe no care
ok. i tried computing the exact value of "an ulupoti of ulupoti" in wolfram alpha
wolfram alpha broke
its a way of literally saying infinity
infinite gods lol
oh and remember death?
and how it became like abstract things? the court of flame is at the cosmological north pole. deaths court is said to be at the south
bc the great star is at the very north
now where do humans fit in?
tru
maybe they were formed from the rivers. the rivers are like streams of energy and meteors roaring from the stars southwards, so thatd explain things.
death/abstract thought + flame/life + meteors/tangibility.
then some beasts get in. then human
humans are magically unique
bc they have like the most magical souls
so maybe it could be that the beasts needed a mediator.
so they went to the courts
and using that they made the people
thus humans are there not to harm or to use the land, but to mediate it
## Convo-38 {Ailurr 16/8/23}
a very important proverb set is about respecting spirits, and one of the most popular analysises, is to respect lawo, as its said the 1st person vantage point is from him
And he was the patron of the imperative family
So the view was popular
Thus thats how hes the biggest
Then theres ahasayunne
Which is like old orthodoxy
But islam
They believe in prophets
And that Lawo is the only god, all others are like chunks that split off
But similar interpretation of proverbs, they just use a different base
Like different proverbs
Like torah v. Quran
Theres also Kanism
Very similar the Old Orthodoxy, but they base it on the current earth, and what others are like
So kinda like science bc it uses what they know to know more
Without mysticism
And at last of the major Oreidiac religions: Goreanism
Its a lot like if the stereotypical paganism survived
Like imagine an aspect of connecting to the wild
Most of oreidica follows those 4 religions
\[most goreans believe to be] Well being an intermediary
And then some groups are just anarchy
Especially the groups nesr Ahasayunne groups
Bc the goreanists and ahasayunnats hate eachother
So ye
They both have clan based groups with communal centres for discussion and deliberation
Its just that Ahasayunne has like organisation of those groups, like the papacy.
However the goreanists are decentralised
And the goreanists have no central doctrine
It arose out of paganism
And they like write letters to nearby locations to spread ideas to like let them spread
But most were oral for the longest time
Sometimes large codices were compiled showing who believed in what doctrines but they were rare, and conducted by Kanists(they are very syncretic) so bias
Btw, the Kanists love information
Like just documenting stuff
Its also an ethno religion
The religion of the 룚sans
Or rather the Wy
I personally like Kanism

in my world, "demons", "elves", and "dwarves" exist. but they are just very divergent humans
imagine them less like different species but more like hyperraces
like races but more different
i.e. the mBo'i and West Cefrinti are like very pale, tall, usually have lighter features, and see very well
meanwhile teh Thul are stocky, short and lots of body hair
even women have it
and then there are the multiplicities in the Pawani
the space nomads
basically: there are 16 major hyperracial groups
there are 18 in all of Asu Delusaje
the other 2 are the Oreidiacs and Rex-Ri
so ye
lots of diversity
some of the most distinctive ones are the Lapkachielli
they have very dark skin, and much more athletic, and short. they are famous for some banging food 
like they have spices, mix them into a powder, then miz in some flour and make bread out it sometimes 
the lapkachiellians make very good food
very spicy
very meaty
not much vegetable
many very spicy emat based dishes
theres also the asons
they are very small
like in population
one of their main features is very acute magic sensiticity
magoptia is very very common
wait no
magoptia would be very rare
so: they also were the firt people in Diz
its an island in oreidica 
on the very south pole
bc theres a valley in diz, whith like statues, and felled forests, and some ruins
volcano + ice => water => hot river => forest
and mysterious symbols
\[who put them there]
the asons
they colonised there and were familiar bc they lived in space
but the people in modern times that live there dont know that
so they are like "wtf is happening in Dhi River
bc theres a bunch of those hot rivers
the asons colonised an island
then like in rapa nui
deforested stuff and them died
otherwise they are a tiny group
The subdivisions im using btw:
realm, hyperrace, race, ethnicity, tribe
realm: like space, oreidica or rex-r
oh
migration out
like ancient migrations
maybe each hyperrace can be consoder subspecies tho
but im not sure how humans spread out yet
im guessing its be ancient spirits just messing around, causing species interchange across the 3 realms, and humans survived
they probs came from rex-r
bc like the 1st death is theoretical
its one of the main theories in oreidica
it explains why there was a sudden small bottleneck for native oredicans

they could theoretically take your mansion, pull it apart, take it to somewhere else for safekeeping, and just give it back
they have like facilities elsewhere to store stuff
you cant imagine \[how powerful they are]
they are part of whats pretty much a mega company
the Imperial Librarians
they control all the roads, have the largest collection of information, have whole trade routes owned by them.
they control a lot
they run census, and archive old stuff
like if you have an old photo, they make copy and store somewhere
they are pretty much built out of a whole ountry of Kanists
they deal with upkeep and information of Oreidica
the thing is: the ruler of it like very experienced and generally he cant be swayed by like bribery
bc hes 5500 yo
very old bc deals with spirits
he pretty much managed to like use spirits to increase his magic to incredible amounts, so hes practically immortal
if a human life is a cup of water, his life is an olympic swimmingpool.
it will end. and he could decide to end it himself.
by like but spewing enough magic out
he has outlived literal nations
he is from like very early on in my worldbuilding.

bc my scripts also are kinda similair.
theres the ancient lucan logography, very carved and sharp
it gets seen by some northern commoners, and they make pre-yodo. then that spreads a bit southwards, meets the Sedites, script adapts, and someone readapts the adaptation back to the Anatolic Languages, to get Yodo. that spreads like wildfire and only leaves some reclusie areas with pre-yodo
then in the harabban valley, lucan logography evolves
it becomes move curvalinear, and very literal in describing things. it usually makes more glyphs for roots by using a radical showing the main concept, and then the other part shows the differentiating bit.

This becomes the Xu script. it becomes standard by the time of the Taknitic Empire.  during this time, the Qaradashi콑 use a form of yodo with a bunch of extra characters loaned from pre-yodo
also: the sedites rereadapted yodo bc it was easier and more popular
so ye
complex in that part
## Convo-41 {Ailurr 20/8/23}
so: early on they put kings in giant tombs of salt with weapons, food, and tablets of accomplishment. then they either buried it shallowly or put out to show
later on, they made 2 tombs. one with a certain symbolic body part in salt, and like basic stuff on it, like birth and death date, name, pedigree; and a second one that was actually buried
the outside tombs are usually much smaller, like brick sized
the biggest gx켻na city name: Il칠xanda콋hgo Il칠xakx칩m칠nda
shortened to Il칠xandarha
it means the city of the bay
but city lit. is unmoving tribe
and bay is unmoving water
so I-l칠xa-nda-콋hgo I-l칠xa-kx칩m칠-nda
not-moving-tribe-of not-moving-water-tribe
in english, i called it Alexandria
but the best bit:
theres a bay named after it
so the name of that bay is:
Il칠kx칩m칠nda 콋hgo Il칠xanda콋hgo Il칠xakx칩m칠nda
lit. the bay of the city of the bay
and Il칠xandarha is a collection of settlement around it, but the proper city is the very end of it, bc theres a river estuary there
bc the gxnna came from benuseli, but discovered the region, and traveled there. then the original places where the gxnna lived had their population reduced, so it became the centre of gxnna culture

that location would be very valuable in trade
bc youd need to go there to get into the Osani Sea
so city forms
like istanbul
bc alexandria controls the south route
so that city controls the north route
if you have been banned from passing, and you are in the osani sea, you콋e stuck

there are 2 mountains
ine on the north pole, one on the south
just are
like near to the poles
and the southern one is a volcano
and bc in diz, that volcano fuels the rivers, it considred the origin of water
it jusy exists
like its right there
its not theoretical
bc theyve seen it erupt
{its on a pole}
yes?
and there's land there
it should be
but people have gon ethere, and seen it erupt
like its active
just bc its cold doesnt mean there cant be a volcano
there have been expeditions to find the sources of the diz rivers, and they lead to the mountain chain of volcanoes. theyve been there
like its cold. but like there exist liveable hot rivers
2 mountains
the south one has rivers coming from it, and is considered the source of all water.
and bc theres an antipodal mountain, that considered the route souls take to be reincarnated , north of south
bc magic like flows with the magnetic feild
so its like very spiritual areas
## Convo-42 {Aillur 21/8/23}
im changing how they bury kings
so they take out the internal organs, and then process then differently. they use salts, but qaradashi salt is very useful for it bc itb kills bacteria a lot more. bc its alkaline.
then they put the internal organs back in
so the graves are pretty much sterile
like how would anything survive

they like using salt
they have a type of meat based on salt
they take meat, strips of it, cover in spices, cook, cover it in more spices, but it in triny bags of cabbage, and put it in big barrels of hot salt
then they press the salt with the bags down, and leave it for a lot of time
then they cook the meat and get with salt-cooked meat
## Convo-43 {Ailurr 22/8/23}
bc like lots of ships would go there
bc theres the 3 way strait.
ships would come from the west, and have a choice to go north or south
then theyd have to come back to that sea to go into the osani sea
bc of the part in the east
so youd go north if you want to reach that sea, or tryto avoid the traffic in the south
but then youd need to get back to the sea, the east one
and theres also traffic there
lol
the subcanals and seas theyd see probs
btw, can u guess which has the most ships docking and sailing off daily?
any ships, not just commercial
i wonder what that regions history is like
bc like many eastern colonists would arrive by the dark blue sea in like the 900s pGc
Total seas:![[Photos/maps/15 seas of osani.png]]

so틣 history
they have whole libraries of archival records
the biggest library in the world is the Gosan Library with literal millions of records
most is locked away from the public, and some is even locked from even the kanist monks who oversee the library 
and only accessible to like 5 people
they do have cleaning staff but they are specifically chosen as unable to read the text's language
bc most are personal records
bc they store like a lot of personal records. where you live, what you buy, sell, etc.
but recent records are like locked down to those 5 people
it is still like unaccessable for pretty much everyone for like 200 years
and what the govt can access is the equivalent of what we get from census data
but like they record stuff. and then its locked down for like 200 years usually. then its collection private. u cant browse, but if u have somethign to find, u can ask for it
and they might give it to you
## Convo-44 {Ailurr 24/8/23}
Im planning out cosmology in my world bc i want to make astrologu
It'll be like zodiacs
But mostly i want to figure out the constellations
Bc the universe is rings in rings
Currently doing all that stuff in geogebra bc precision
Bc theres the normal solar system stuff
But the the solar systems themselves orbit
And those orbits have precession
will oreidica and rexr ever crash: no
i will do any sorts of cursed math to make sure
the orbits and precession line up
but they are visible from eachother
ill try and figure out how to use variables to get it automatically move
rec-r completes an orbit every 19 years, oreidica every 24
well yes
its solar systems orbiting the centre of the universe
not planets
imma change it actually. 45 for rexr and 48 for oreidica
thus they both return to their original positions every 2,160 years
theres also precession
which is the orbits themselves spin around
I wonder if any software could like show what the view would be from lets say oreidica of the sky
Bc Rex-R from oreidica is a bright planet
Like venus
The name RexR has been revised as being the name of that star in east huddey
oreidica will precess fully every 6000 years
that means that every 16 years, the sky will be offset by 1 degree
but in an average lufetime, the sky would move by 6 degrees
and: they cantcrash into eachother
the procession is in the same direction, so they dont cross
but they can get close
the gold dot, oreidica, and rex-r always form a single plane with the universal equator.
i wonder what sorts of star views there are
bc of the first movement of the globe, but also the orbits, and procession, means that it changesevery year by a tiny bit, adding up
imagine the astrology and it just goes fully out of date
im figuring stuff out and
if in year 1, star E was over your head a specific time
by 6 years, its be 3 months off
by 24 years, half a year off
by 48 years, its be correct again 
so ye
astrology would be much mathier
and imagine it across planets
like u were born on oreidica v. rex-r
also: the orbits are technically 48 years long for oreidica but adding in the procession makes it go 360 degrees in closer to 47 years and 8 months
I figured out some astrology stuff 
its just as bs as the real thing
so i did it successfully
now time to also account planet rotation
the black lines show the "houses" of the universe
they are concentric
so틣 from inner to outer the houses are틣 throne room, palace, courtyard, moat, wall
the outer thin strip is the wall
the gold dot in the middle is the mambu, the gold dots on the walls are the major ends.
or the orbits are there, and the long red and green lines are their axes.
is mambu the sun yes or no: no
Big shiny thing
I have decided yet
So, you get what each part is?
The purple dots and dotted lines are for astrology only
the rhombus thingies are whole solar systemm things
they have their own suns
So get the year you're born it, and take it to the major end of the axis of the planet you were born on.
The dotted line shows in which house that time is in for you based on birthday.
The house you're in is the highest one the line goes through.
The higher Room the better luck, life and fortun캧 is experted
Itll be more complex but ye
The dotted lines let you see which house
And the times when u change house, they are seen as either very lucky or unlucky, bc the lines to the minor end work the same but with bad luck

## Convo-45 {Ailurr 25/8/23}
there was a peaceful revolution in one of my empires
like a full on coup detat that had no casualties
so: there was a high up noble tat was dissatisfied with the current emperor
and the empire held control via pali taxes(labour, money, or grain)so, he decided to get a bunch of nobles to give him the taxes, not to the emperor. so when the emperor died, the new emperor got no taxes whatsoever
and bc the emperor couldnt do anything, bc no taxes=no labour=no army, so no casualties
so a full on coup. no casualties
and bc when he died, the expectation were raised, the empire got better
and that paved the way for the iroci golden age
during that time, certain minorities stopped being persectued in the harabban empire (bc they mostly forgot those laws existed), so now they coudl enter safely; and land laws were fixed, so migration became more rampant
so a random noble causing a coup made the empire better
btw: taxes are like a set value based on wealth and manpower. they can be paid in: manual labour/army work, grains, or money
and they have a set conversion rate

there was a blind emperor
Lan I was born blind and was the oldest son of Ui I. he was known for scholarship
inventing a basic version of Xu for the blind
so ye. Lan I was a good emperhe also made a system from Gx켻na as it was one of the 3 official languages, but it didnt rly catch on
or by helping blind people
o ye Gx켻na fully survived the bad times. it even became a major power
He didn't make a system for the 3rd official lang tho bc it wasn't rly used and it was dying out
Ye...
In the modern day, only a few thousand people still speak it
But after the Iroci Golden Age, there were like 30 official languages
Bc
1. The languages split up
2. minority languages
## Convo-46 {Ailurr 26/8/23}
ive figured out the early empires govt system
so: at the very top is the Takunuti
but he is at the top ceremonially
theres also the ruler of Alexandria, and Patriarch of Lyaos
they each rule a chunk of the whole empire, the biggest and core one is the Harabban empire, ruled directly by the Takunuti
now, each chunk is pretty much indipendent in law, but travel and trade between them is free. if one of the leaders want to make a change or edict in anothers land, all 3 have to agree to it
o ye.
all the land is split into clanlands. lands ruled by clans. they are groups together into Elezamis, then those in Eledelis. each Eledeli is ruled by a noble. the Eledelis and Elezamis can fight eachother and usually are full of complex borders, enclaves and exclaves
{what time period is harabban empire}
6000 - 0 BP
but the time period im discussing here is the 6000 - 5000 BP period
so:
taxes
they are called ibapali. they can either be paid in manual labour, money, or grain. each clanland has a specific cost they need to pay in total based on population, area, and trade. they also have minimum quotas to pay in each of the three forms. the govt gets the return forms of what each clanland is paying, then implements it, like if the manual labour is going to the army, or building roads, or just making pots.
the Ntedh故kx칩m칠gxa and Lyaos Patriarchate arent decided yet

i have a picture

snake+lion+wings+human
its the babylonian thing ut snake
oh, nah thats just the verb forms from that conlang i was making
and its just overlapping
![[Photos/topic/fort kase.png]]
6 pixels = 1 mete
its a type of colonial fort
imma explain
the purple are where most people lives
the dark grey on the outside and brown are wall
the less dark gray are gates
like lighter greys are paths
and in the outer areas, they are either:
in the living areas, flat bricked courtyards
in the front, grassy courtyard
and the yellow to red bits are like fort
yes
usually, whole clans live in kinda isolated areas
a whole family (2-6) can live in 1 purple strip 
and these 'kase lekeka' are colonial fortzs, meant as bases to live and stop at 
they are built across rex-r as like waypoints
the central pink thing is a tower, usually with a fire at the top at night
the red is a storage area and support
the small orange behind it is extra support and stirage
the oranges are transport and existing areas
the yellow is a courtyard around it
they need places to transport things, and to just chill in when not working in making things, or transporting things, but still on fort duty
the whole fort is elevated, and each sucessive colour up to the tower is higher and higher up
also its a platform for it to be built on and to get to and from
i wonder if i can make it on isometric paper to show what it looks like from a diff perspective
btw: max people in one of these forts is like 550 people
they are very useful
they can hold strategic areas
bc lots of people there, and quick transport in and out
in the first hundred years or so of harabban colonisation in rex-r, they built 82 of those forts
this is still like what wed consider prehistoric
remember the space nomads
ye. at least its not like 6 kya
its more like 5 kya
still very far back... but not as far back
also, i feel i should like do so the 82 were made over a longer time frame
the first 1k
but ye
they colonised another planet in 5500 ya before even kowing all of their planet
but bc of the kase, they helped trade in rex-r increase, and introduced large scale agriculture
the thullic kingdom meanwhile was chilling
![[Photos/maps/thulic kingdom.png]]
it occupies a nearly frozen archipelago
it was at the same time as the first harabban coming into rex-r
i should set back the time of rex-r colonisation by the harabbans
from 5500 BP to maybe like the time of that empress
so like 5800 BP
still early on but like...
harabbans wouldve come to rex-r by 5500 BP, but colonisation wouldve happened
oh ye
theyd gain a lot of words
bc loans and new environment
like a word for rainforest
a. well itd mostly be words for unfamiliar things
and loans

bc clans living in large buildings, and they are relatively sparce
that came about bc the bad times.
thus the name. Century of Tribal Collapse
remember what the bad times are.
so ye. Century of Tribal Collapse is the formal name
bc the Tribal system collapsed. and the Clan System formed
a tribe is an ethnolinguistic, large group of localised people
a clan is a familial dynasty, passed down from the male line
thats the difference in my world

ooh idea. north thulic has the polynesian vibes, and areally, the island esque north 코efrinti get those vibes
now how to get north thulic...
the thullic language family is very very old
like iirc i set proto thullic at 18kya
ye its old
and north thullic is one branch
there are 4 branches
its the biggest branch but
maybe proto thulic is a small phono language
the proto thulic peoples were desert wanderers, who during this period decided "yk whatd be nice? being the dominant power"
then they exploded out of their now unknown homeland, and became a major steppe people
that lasted from 18 kya to around 12 kya
then they formed tribes and tribal confederacies
forming a few major groups
its thought around 12
so, from 12 kya onwards, another period of migration occurred. they travelled outwards from the desert. 2 groups went to the islands, and they formed major regions far from the desert, being overtaken
that period lasted until like 8 kya
then other groups came along, and wittled down the power of the south thulics
one of the main things is the rise of the mBo'i in the 7-6kya
destroying the far eastern thuls into a few tribes
but the north thuls are still doing well
so thats the thuls
and out of the original 12 groups, 4 remain
the most recent to die out by 6kya is the south island thul, which died out in the expansion of 코efrinti
## Convo-48 {Ailurr 29/8/23}
theres a plant in my conworld that helps make sugar out of nearly anything
it has an enzyme that breaks down cellulose into simpler sugars
so you can chuck some sawdust into distilled version it, and it slowly becomes sugar water
also, bc the labyrinthus cefrintii got mostly colonised under one state, a south 코efrinti koine formed
u remember that empire that was a combo of 3 states?
well, later on it becomes more 
so theres 2 groups
the oreidiac ones, with harabban, alexndrians, lyaos, dao
and the rexri. thul, sefrinti, anatolija bawala
the thuls acc are more indipendent bc its kinda hard getting there
to get from the capital of the whole empire to the thul capital you:
need to get a train to the qaradashi trade region
Wait until a ship from rexr comes and get there (that could be quite some time)
then get to bawala, and get a ship to get you to the icy seas
then get another ship to get to the capital
{spoace nomads they just sometimes pull up, most often into the qaradashi trade region, which is quite far away from qaradash
and that how u get to rexr and bac. the empire has hired a whole tribe just to transport stuff
they never however actually conquer the spcae nomads
bc theres too many, too far away, and also too low density
but the space nomads once tried invading the empire
and they nearly suceeded
like the empire itd do well
bc it happened later on
when most of the empire fell out of the fold
bc at some point, the empire became too big
so: the multi state method kinda just fell apart
the other bits became practically indipendent
the takunuti is still like very important. he still can do overarching government stuff, but hes not as powerful.
he still the biggest religious head tho
but like, it got giant
they mostly centralised very hard
they had the substate system
and bc spread of habitation was quite regulated, it had a bunch of infrastructure made
they got too big
bc they ruled pretty much their whole planet
yes they did have magic
they had magical airplanes
ye....
this is one of the eldritch things
and on paper, they still rule their entire planet
but practically? nah
not at all
its in the same way that the leader of the un is
so ye. the empire still technically rules the whole planet, but cant do anything, and they act more like a un

dyt that living in the empire would be nice?
bc like it has infrastructure
good governance
and it lets lgbt people exist
you remember what i told u about the clan system?
you are seen more as a part of your clan. you work for your clan and its honour.
if your clan leader asks you to do something, you should do it
every clan has pretty much a giant mansion for it
and they are lead by a head of the clan, you can decide who does what. are the cooking, farming, buying or sellign?
in many clans, the process is on a rota or democratic

the bakuan cheiftainships...
they are a tribal marshland with a thick forest
very tribalistuc
they have small chieftainships ruled by chiefs, that arent passed genealogically
they mostly hunt for food
the alexandrians also follow a family based system, but its different to the clan system
## Convo-49 {Ailurr 30/8/23}
the original mythical thuls were considered "full fire blood"
the thuls in the core of the empire are full fire thuls usually too
if a thul marries a non thuls, their children are half fire thuls. if a half fire thuls has a child with a non thul, their children are quarter fire thuls, etc.
if a thul has a children with another thuls, their child will be the xth fire thul of the parent with the lowest rank
e.g. if a quarter fire thul has a child with a full fire thul, the child will be quarter fire
a person who: has a living full fire thul grandparent, has no full fire thul parents, and does a certain ceremony
they are considered "relit fire thuls"
that means that in genealogical terms, they are treated a full fire terms onwards.
a person can revoke their thul fire if they wish to

this system influences whether a person can do things in a thul society. e.g. to be a priest, you need to be a sixteenth, eightth, quarter, half or full fire thul; to be a king of the thuls you need to be descended from another king and be a full fire thul
its meant for a certain ethncitiy. if you dont feel connected to it, u can leave
i made a certain family tree that, with minimal inbreeding (only 1 marraige of half 1st cousins and then 7th cousins) can get a full fire blood thuls from just one full fire thul ancestor
and the rules to be kings, that means that if that family line was on some other country, that guy at the end could be like "nuh uh, imma be king"
and if that half thul sibling is from an earlier marriage than the actual line of kings, theyd have a better right
and bc religious instutions are important to the exiled thuls (bc relit fire thuls need a religious style ceremony), there exist familial records
they also undergo a bar mitzah or bat mitzah style ceremony to like entrench moral and historical values
tbh, its useful to have community when u live on an icy archupelago
but: there exist religious thuls
they dont speak thulic languages
they dont have thullic ancestry rly
but they are full fire thuls, and can follow thulic society
## Convo-50 {Ailurr 31/8/23}
im thinking of empire
and how it works so well
maybe they have a constitution to keep govt continuous
and a clause that lets the givt get rid of bad emperors
so an emperor dies, his son succeeds
the govt "nuh uh"
the govt needs to approve it
and they can only be used for a limited amount of things
if u manage to get everyone tojust not be ruled by the empire, you can replace them
but what the empire provides, its too good to just get rid of it
food aid, construction, maintenance, medicine
the govt is too delocalised to do that
ud need to arrange to get to a dozen fortified cities
its centralised
as in one head
but delocalised
not one place
its across multiple cities
explaining how it grew so large
and great
they also had an empress
they did have multiple after the consitution
but upto the consitution, yes. 1 by her own right, and she implemented the consitution
empresses by marriage where very powerful, arguably more than emperors, but there went any by their own right yet 

u can be a half fire thul that cant be relit
you need to have a living full fire/relit fire thul grandparent, and no full fire thul parent to be relit
so if you have one full fire thul as a parent and a non thul parent, ud ber half fire, but cant relight
or: you have 2 half fire thul parents, but all your full fire thul grandparents are dead, u cant relight
or even, all 4 of your grandparents are half fire thuls
so some half fire thuls cant relight, but some quarter fire thuls can. hell, even some lower form thuls can
bc if u have a grandparent thats full fire thul, they married a non thul, and their child, your parent, id a half thul
then the half thul marries someone that, lets say, is a sixtyfourth fire thul. thusly, u would be a sixtyfourth fire thul that can relight
you cant rly join thul society in your own right (if ur a non-thul)
like become a priest, do any rituals, etc.
or become a noble
you can via getting a relation with a thul
but like its pretty much closed
outside of thul society, u are a normal person. thats what it means to the thuls.
but u can live in thul majority areas, u can bewith thuls
thul systems are for thuls
also: in the thul system, women are higher than men
they aare meant to raise the children, are more common as priests, and lead houses
they are rulers of groups of houses, and lead in battles, and provide
thoseare the expectations
but: women can do anything men can
they live in big houses with like 100+ people, eating and doing stuff communally bc the snow
the thuls came from a migration of a pre-civilisation into there
and they have fire magic that lets the survive bette
what should their clothes look like?
they live in conditions similair to south water tribes, but they have magic like the fire nation, but like less powerfuld o to rex-ri magic styles
also ive figured ou thewir food
im guessing lots of wool
bc after all, their population cores arte very cold
and usually so snowy its hard to leave the communla house
thats y communal house
maybe they have lots of layers
maybe also so that its ez to take off, so that they can like take it off when inside, and then back on ez

thul skin is generally multi coloured
it just is
genetics. remember the races thing in my conworld?
oh
well the races are more numerous and different
and the thuls are a distinct race
and one of the features is varying pigmentation
whether it be multicoloured hair, or skin, or eyes
the thul word for them is "burns"
like burn marks
bc the fire is seen as the core of a thul soul
and the souls heat and fire burns the skin
thats why full fire thul
also light hair is very common
ginger, blonde, white
red]
their society doesnt force you to be any certain thing
you can be apriest, a herder, a gatherer, a ruler, etc.
they also: make very big houses
very long
bc the snow covers up a lot
they also have a heavily meatbased diet
and spicy and hot
similair to indian cuisine
yes
id guess probably something like... imagine if scandinavia was further north and an island
there is no equivalent
its its ow thing
they have no cultural equivalent tho
also: their food is quite sweet too
they cook very slowly, so its tender and sweet
non thuls dont rl participate in thul society in their own right.
like they dont live in the longhouses just bc, they need a thul child or spouse
but the matriarchy doesnt rly apply bc they arent thuls
the non thuls either live not in thul land, or they live just by themselves, assimilating

the thuls had an incident once
so the process of becoming a non thul is called being 'extinguished'
once a non thul family came up and asked to be extinguished
the thuls priests didnt even know how to respons
but the non thul family couldnt rly speak standard north thulic
the thulc ourts just went "ok whatever" and di the process
bc they didnt want to be thu;
and they lived in thul lands
and they were very po'oka
so they wanted make double sure
a souther island in the thulic lands thats technically q||ukid in ethnicity
the q||ukid are an ethnic group i hadnt mentioned yet
so ye. it took years to figure out what they exactly wanted bc the dialect they spoke wasnt available
its a strange episode in thulic law
they were proud of their small ethnicity
so they just "hello we no wnat be thul pliz" "umm ok. are u thul" "no we po'oka" "o....k"

many chunks of rexr are anarchy
bc uncivilised
they are just desert tribes, chilling and pillaging
in recent times tho, a great empire rose
from the east
they grew in a short time, but fell just as fast
the mBo'i
in Bogi => in mBogi => mBo'i
those people

also: the thul mythology is sometimes dumb.
if you die with a knife in your hand and arent eating, your afterlife is treated in the same way as a soldier 
bc its technically a weapon
and the word for soldier is "he who has a weapon"
so....
they ahve a "king". but he is like but ceremonial.
and they have individual rule
each longhouse rules itself, but they can join together

it split into 2 langs
and one of them split too
the migrations of the minority langs is very interesting
they were usually spread out thin. but then once they merged into the clan system, they congregated in certain areas.
however, many did flee into sympathetic provinces, staying in hiding until 500 bGc when Iroci repeaked oppresive laws
imma copy a thing from shinto

in shinto, a master sumo wrestler is seen as string enough to house a kami
i could copy that
so they alr have spirit devotion, being polytheistic
and they are oppressed
i feel theyd fit with the ones in the sympathetic provinces, that someone who can house a god is powerful enough to overthrow and win freedom
the major culture, the harabbans, alr have the idea that the emperor and empire are protected by spirits and gods, so maybe that combines with that idea once they stop getting oppressed, that the king of them should be a vessel for the gods
they had an indipendent kingdom for only a few decades.
then they merged under another kingdom, and that kingdom had like immortal kings bc they were actual vessels for spirits
one of the immortal kings did indeed die
bc he had less spirit
and the other is still alive
by now hes 5500yo
its said that his body is made of milk bc milk helps him heal.
its mostly bc milk is very nutritous

explaining magic a bit more
a single peice of magic is tiny bit of power and conciousness
like veryu tiny
and they can combine together sometimes
but bc it is small bits of power, its volatile
not volatile like explosion, but like they combine and break apart very easily
spirits are just giant clumps of magic
however, human soul magic is unvolatile
while ur alive
once u die, it become volatile and can fall apart
and magic can connect in non direct ways
thus: willpwer magic
if u believe in something in either high enough amounts or strongly enough, it will affect magic in a way so you are more correct
## Convo-54 {Ailurr 9/9/23}
yk the harabban empire?
well: itd be formed with 120 provinces
but when it joins with the ghnna, itd give 11 of them to the ghnna
so then itd have 109 provinces
now:theres a nazi dogwhistle of using 109 bc supposedly jews were kiced out of 109 countries
and bc persecution of the minorities, that aligns
but when the provinces get remade with iroci, that change would be done at the same times as the persecutions being lifted
Iroci being one of the emperors
he did a lot of reforms
two of them being reforming the provinces
and lifting persecution
so its like some nice connotations
also: the provinces have a census happen in each of them every 12 years
it checks what the people are doing, what the geography is up to, and the sky is up to
like figure out where rivers are
or if new hills have formed via depositing dirt
or coasts changed
so ye
beeg censuses
also: the provinces would have a ton of exclaves and enclaves
clan system
its a bit more complex, but ye
imagine the maps
bc rn, im kinda close to finshing the current map

ghnna provinces
they have at least 12
bc they get the 11 from harabban in the great treaty
and def have at least 1 before that
the taknitic empire is made up 3 countries
and each county has a few regions
And those regions are split into provinces

the gxnna are a whole country\
bc the taknitic empire had formed, and finished of the bad times, with the lyaos as a vassal and the gxnna in the outh as only rivals left
so they tried to invade and wage war
they failed bad, so they signed a treaty of unification, and lyaos, gxnna and harabban empire formed a single big state
the region the ghnna ruled after treaty
![[Photos/maps/ghnna territory.png]]
the things to the northeast were given with the treaty
the peninsula was also disputed terittory, so it was 1 province bc no maps
It was split up into multiple by the ghnna

how would the harbbans develop a standard length measurement
perhaps they could the the length of the lucan river as a base
bc the lucan river isnt a real river
its a road
they call it a river tho
bc
it brought tons of resources
like thr iver
i want the measurement standard to be close to the metre
bc the lucan road is what connected anatolia to the amosi heartland, bc they were disconnected by a lot
it was very militarised
and still kinda exists
## Convo-55 {Ailurr 10/9/23}
OH ON CENSUSES
they also do linguistic censuses
like they record dialects, and new words, etc.
they occur more rarely comnpared censuses tho
but they still happen regularly
they also developed something like a gpa
and:
they have standards on how to keep records
defined letter sizes, letter shapes, and medium
and then they can transcribe them into painfully compact media
like a bible's worth of text would be stuffed onto like a scroll of ~12cm diametre, ~18cm height
so its very compact
very thin paper
very small text
and very tight coil
they use specific machinery to read them well, involving magnification, but ye
they even have methods making it even more compact, but those were only developed further in the future
so thats how they can keep such dense records
density
## Convo-56 {Ailurr 15/9/23}
im thinking of dictionaries
they organise it kinda liek arabic
+ chinesde

i made a conworld antibiotic
its wood glue
it take cellulose fibres, which make vcell walls, and tangle and tie them up
binding and killing bacteria
but also gluing wood together
and can cause lots of constipation
bc fibre
its made of cellulose
imagine discovering it. like u put wood glue on a wound and dam. no infection

## 1. Magic
magic can affect in any way, such as, if there is a religious belief of an inanimate object, the inanimate objects gets affected slightly. a similair, slighter effect can be done on people.
spirits are just collected up magic, smaller spirits collapses more easily, larger less. they can affect the real world. souls are just spirits stuck to a person, so it, for the lack of a better word, crystallises in a unique way.
magic can also be attached to objects, to exert a continuous force.
Most people can control specific forms of matter using elemental groups, earth, air, water, plant, metal and fire. the original one is earth.
## 2. Roads
A common form of transport. usually walkable, or used with horse driven carriages. there exist roads, which once were only used for large destinations, but now are commonplace. they were always used, but trains, invented in 200 pGc, were first sued for the Wisuja(lit. people's road) which first stretched from Nuzw'ha, to Hambarkga, Takunuti and finally to a port leading to Alexandria. Train roads are made of uniform blocks made of clay, connected by oils, which emulsify the clay particles in the wet clay, and then connects it. Takunuti VII was famous for expanding the rail road system.
## 3. Scripts
there exists the Xu /툮u/ script family, which originates from petroglyphs by the Lucan civilisation, and got spread around related languages. It is logographic. it has chinese aesthetics, and its very clunky. has two forms, stone and bamboo. bamboo is drawn with a brush on paper/wood/bamboo. stone script is much more circular, smooth, and representative of the idea; its carved on stone, and is much more simialir to the ancient petroglyphs.
the 콫u scripts are phonetic, and much more common. they sprouted around after the Xu scripts, to fit the much more complex languages around, and are still in common use, the most popular is the Ma script, invented by Emporer ???, in 504, to fit the languages of his minority peoples, due to the fact that the Xu script would fit it, and other 콫u scripts went extinct. it was used across the empire, as the only official 콫u script in the Taknitic empire.
## 4. Taknunuti the Godly
The founder of the Taknitic clan, standardised the Xu script. He created the Taknitic empire.
The text already on his early life:
Birth date: 12th Linqi 7bGc
Death date: 28th Yel 103pGc
Spouse: Ye'e Tyruzsi
Born Ejizamo, he was born in the Hambarkga Palace, and was raised there in this
youth. In 1bGc, he moved to the Takunuti Palace, due to his father being crowned.
When he was 10, the Southern Genocide started. During this time, he was made
prince of Greater Anatolia, under regency of his uncles. On the 4th of Mvodi,
7pGc, at age 14, after his father's death, he was crowned as "Kunuti to Cawi".
In the next year, his army wiped out the Miitoe, and over 9pGc, he set up an
alliance with the Liaos, ramped up the production of weapons, and during this
time, the Hodtei tribe was split over the issue, the West Hodtei joining him,
and the East Hodtei joining the Galilean league, which ruled over the remaining
tribes. OIn the 19th Mvodi 10pGc, The Last Galilean War was waged, was lasted 10
days, wiping out the armies and camps of the remainign tribes, fully killing the
Alranites, Ghnna and a majority of the Samachian, East Hodtei and Vondhah tribes'
male lines. Many Vondhah, East Hodtei and Samachians fled northwards, into Liaos
lands. remaing Vondhah is their homeland were killed off over the enxt few years.
On 1st Linqi 13pGc, at age 20, he gained full control, and established the Amosi 
Kingdom as the Taknitic Empire, establishing himself as Takunuti, with the Liaos
regions being autonoumous.
On the 29th Yel, 14pGc, He had his first son, Ano, named after his close confidant,
Ano.
His title Takunuti means 'all-king', which was lexicalsied to hegemon, or emperor.
## 5. Khaney Tribe History
The Khaney tribe immigrated across the Ney sea after the Waseri Lucan collapse
The Kanai tribe lived in what is now Kli Bagr, Macedona, and is the most distantly related to the other tribes. Supposedly, they were descended from Ondar, the eldest son of D캐sh, ergo the sub-ethnicity they belonged to was called the Ondraitou Sub-ethnicity. Due to its warm climate, it grew many fruits, such as the Bitter and Sweet Mu캚, many forms of Wild Melons, 캯ilk, a flower similar to lavender, and a unique form of rice called Cubbal, which has a dark blue colour, and a salty and sweet taste, such as a cracker. Due to the production of wild melons, it produced many high quality cloths, with beige colours, but white cloths still being made, but at lower amounts. They also make blue dyed cloths using Cubbal rice, usually costing 3.5 times more.
The language of the Kanai tribe was described ㄸs smooth As a table of marble, open as a doorrepresenting specifics by statatives, ownership, action and more by it. These could mean that it had liquid lenition and articles. With the use of other descriptions the first three lines of The Prophets translated into the Kanai dialect c. 150bGc is approximately   .
Their culture of sewing was highly important to them, as they had over 694 known types of looms, handheld looms were the most common, but uniform, with only 14 varieties, the majority of loom types were 땁tokke looms, used to combine the smaller cloths made by handheld looms. There were over 431 types that we know of. Due to how the handheld looms work, they visibly have repetitive rectanguloid shapes, called Kanami. Their most famous work is the Yu콮of To Aki which means approximately Joseph뗩 Greatest Work, probably being the name of the artisan or merchant who dealt with it. It was worn by the kings of the Kanai tribe, then the Amosi tribe for nearly 300 years. Yusuf To Aki was made of 16 paper thin pieces of cloth, with each Kanami made of different colours. The last king to wear it was Lan  [351-357]. Parts of The Yu콮of To Aki still exist, and are displayed in the Baghdad Museum. It was supposedly 8 metres long from top to bottom when worn.
Due to the distance of the Kanai tribe to the others, and due to the fact they were the only descendants of Kanai, the further western tribes saw them as barbarian-esque. This caused the distancing and the apathy to the things that occured to them, mostly by the more powerful central and western tribes. In the Pre-Genocidal Period, the travel of goods to and from Kanelai slowed, because of a drought in that area of West Anatolia, itself causing by the currents leading saltier waters to the rivers and coasts; making the colour of Cubbal Lilac became rarer, associated with Anatolia especially the eastern parts of it. By 17-6-94bGc, the  Kanai tribe was in such an economic state due to the decline of trade, that when the Amosi tribe invaded in their ploy to consolidate power, the Kanai tribe lost in 6 days. Their equivalent of a flag or a crest, which was pasted on their shields, was this:
The crown has the colour of their well-known Cubbal rice, which helped their populations throughout winters, and subsisted most of their exports through their history. The crown is turned on its side, to show how the royalty is non-absolute, and listens to its people and senate, unlike the nobility and monarchies of other tribes. The background is a beige colour, and that is the colour of the cloths they often make.
After losing the Kanai war, an overwhelming majority of the Kanai Population was enslaved by the Amosi tribe, the few that weren뗪 enslaved were the ones that intermarried into and from their royal family, such as Akara Ondriis, daughter-in-law of the Amosi king at the time. All the enslaved populus was used as free labour from the time period between 29-4-94bGc and 17-2-93bGc, the ones who were best at weaving, weaving intricate cloths, now remembered as Cloths of Blood, Toil and Death; the ones better at smithing and building used for projects with intense which involve physical labour, such as construction projects;, the unskilled children were used as either messengers, mill spinners, or sowers. The intelligent parts of the populus were used for tasks that included intelligence, such as letter writing, preservation of scriptures, designing of projects and more. The unskilled adults were used as cannon-fodder, mill spinners and farmers.
In the time period between 6-1-93bGc and 28-3-93bGc, a construction project which was built by the builders was finished, a cylindrical hall with a heavily heated floor, tilted towards the centre, covered in non-stick material, with a movable ceiling covered in hooks, and small watching area, from which you can access all the hooks. The project was 120 metres tall, and with a radius of 55 metres, all the walls being 2.4 metres thick, and the tilted floor at 17.5춿 downwards into a pit with a 12.54 metre diameter. During the time period, the enslaved populus of the Kanai tribe, who by then called themselves the Ondihkesi, were slaughtered, by slashing their entire bodies, and hanging them upside down on the hooks. The last Ondihkesi to die was a weaver girl called Isaafeu Ohkes, on the 28-3-93bGc, in the afternoon. The labour of the Ondihkesi stopped at 17-2-93bGc, as only 23.7% of their population remained, and preparations for the final slaughters were done.
Out of the blood of the slaughtered Ondihkesi, artisans and medics made a form of iron, now known as Kantui Buda. It has a reddish tint to it, and a beautiful shimmer. It is stored with the other irons of the nations in a bank in Irqii City, called Safe and Memorial to the Dead Nations of Dash. There were 11.4 kilograms of it produced.
## 6. Structure of Early Empire
The empire is ceremonially ruled by the Taknitic Emporer, among three major rulers, the Alexandrian Macri, Lyaos Patriarch, and the Takunuti
They each control a realm within, the Macri controlled the Alexandrian City and Gahan, the Patriarch controlled the Lyaos area, and the Takunuti the rest of the empire. For one member to exert control over another area, they need permission from all three.
The Alexandrian city is split into neighbourhoods, and the Gahan as Cikheif칠dh콂u (also knowing afterwards) regions, in reference to keeping the rights of the Neo-Ghnna people, for them to know after death of the Ghnna.
The Takunuti's Land is split into clanlands, which are ruled by certain clans, or clan branches.
The Patriarch's land was split into many regions controlled by local lords, who went ditrectly to the Patriarch; the clan based system of the Takunuti's land got more popular in the Lyaos land.
Over time, the Gahan region got moved to the Takunuti's realm, leaving a handful of city states and the Alexandria region.
Takunuti was the capital, where administration was done, and taxes were held. This made the Takunuti region the most powerful.
The Taknitic Empire-The empire as a whole
The Harabban Empire the region only ruled directly by the Takunuti

## 7. History of the Island of Ban
The island of Ban, named after its namesake discoverer, Ban, possibly being inspired off of the commander of the island's discovery, was discovered ~1400 bGc, by South Anatolic sailors. and then some East Anatolic settlers came, creating the unique phenotype. They spoke a South Anatolic language. Thta language was drivven to extinction by the Seda migration from further inland, who migrated from there all the way to Ban. they set up a large series of shepherding lordships, which slowly united into a few fiefdoms, which were, ~90 bGc, united under a high king under the influence of the Amosi, who didn't kill them, as they were seen as powerful allies, who could gaurd their new colonies. In 6 bGc, before the yearly celebartion of Storms, when every man of Banite clanship returns to Ban, a handful of pirates arrived and shelled parts of the coast. During the celebration itself, the cracks formed widened, and then split open, expunging scalding volatile gases across the whole island. due to the sudden loss in volume across the whole island, a giant earthquake occurred too. Due to the timely arrival of the storms, the volatile gases solidified into large formations of Bakhti, which had special properties, making it Banite stone. The volatile gases continued being expelled over the follwoing few thousand years, via cracks, and every few decades, following earthquakes occurred. In the autumn of 4870, a giant storm went over Ban, ridding the rest of the volatile fumes, and allowing settlement of the region.
## 8. An ethnography of  Macedonans
The Macedonans emerged approximately ~3000pGe, descended from the South Dolans, staying in the many mountains of the areas, and continuing their pagan beliefs as the Gorean Invasions occurred across the rest of Thyaria.
They created many independent city states, and traded heavily with the neighbouring Ilian peoples, however, when the great fort city of Ilias fell, they mostly fled to Macedona.
They continued as tribalistic herders, using longhouses as clanhouses, continuing their beliefs in the mountains, partially settling in Western Anatolia.
Around 5000, the kingdom of Albania invade southwards into there, not managing to get further than Daisula, keeping a heartland for the Macedonans in Macedona proper, while many emigrated to Cypra and Domia, settling the airconter presence until today. During this time period, many more peoples came from West Anatolia, and The North West, from the Pangars.
The Albanian Kingdom fell apart, leaving many city states there, many of which reverts from South Gorean Orthodoxy to Macedonan Paganism. This formed a divergence ~5300, the northern form being more like the Gorean religion, the southern being more traditional, and the Islanders Islandering Islanderly.
In 5600-'700, the Santerranese kicked the door open and inveded them completely. They tried mass conversion, which caused mass migrations into Anatolia, however, manystayed and assimilated into Santerranese.
Under Governer M패eskaz팳, the culture of the Macedonans was crushed, the communal longhouses were converted into large Tempular Clanhouses, the use of idols in Macedonan Paganism was banned, and there were 63 different expeditions to try and invade the islands and the deep core of their heartland. Governer M패eskaz팳 ruled over the most of Santerranese rule, until Macedona's indipendence
He ruled from 5734 to 5821, his life's mission was to destroy the Macedonan culture. 
During the Indipendence, many older reffugees from Anatolia returned, and many crypto-Pagans reverted, producing a religious civil war from 5845-5803, which still has reprocusions. Currently, they are a republic and the fourth most pagan country in Thyaria.
Their current leader is Uu팯ndasse팶 Por(5990-), from the Islands, which just islanded as indipendent prncipalities for a few centuries
## 9. Info Dump
Cewoga Lawo is the proper name for the head deity of the Old Orthodox religion. It is sacreligious to utter that name, and can only be uttered by the emperor or high priests during the coronation, or the 3 high festivals; The Days of Rains, Harvest, and Death.
huh. in mine, the imperial family are vessels for incredibly powerful spirits, and with the high priests, they formed a society, ehich controls all information, records and is near all-powerful.
theres a plant that produces so much pollen, it clogs the respiratory tract of people there. Imagine seeing a flower, checking what it smells like, and then choking to death.
the santerranese empire didn't take the Nuzwhic Empire and Shandi
and the Nuzwhic Empire was just a puppet state (콭o Dynasty) so...
if you act as a man, you are one. if you act s a woman, you are one. if you act as a farmer, you are one
gender only acts a method to understand positions of inheritance and marriage
for them it was just: women marry to men, and men usually gain inheritance. that was the main thing. before, if you could work, you did
humans were few in number and had a small range. the land was new, wild, and needed to be used. thus, they all worked.
also, a cool conworld thing: clans. clans keep together always. blood runs thick. due to the fact they exist in every society, and trace themslevs, they form decentralised kingdoms, kept by each clan working together. a clan is just a usually patrilineally related family, which could be just a dozen or so people in a small valley, or hundreds in great palaces.
they also often grouped up into a 'porok' which are just small sets of clans, so that they can be stronger. then poroks wouls group together via trade.
a downside of the clan system is that people without clans can really gain support structures. so if you were plopped in the conworld, you wouldn't be able to gain help, unless you form a clan, become a priest, or join clans as mediators or iterant workers.
the clan system keeps groups together, and as it originally ruled over them, all of them pay lip service (and taxes) to the emperor. thusly, money and clout, as they descended from incredibly powerful monarchs
The Taraq Civilisation seems to be an advanced society, which farmed on the mountaintops of the Tariq mountains, ~3000bGc.
They seem to have invented the calendar, been the first to settle in Hambarkga, and might have been the ancestors of the Seda,
falling and migarting away after a series of heavey storms and earthquakes, and a mass migration shown by archeology from East Anatolia
deep southwards, into the areas of the Seda urheimat.
in my conculture, they can chose a personal name, as it is theirs
an ethnicity that is enslaved, and they keep together exclusively by culture.
they are the only enslaved ethnicity
they are closed, as they are a slave class, but basically, anyone that can speak their language, and recite their poems, are Exkeremelohans too
they are the only slave class. some groups have been spearated from their homes and typical society for millenia. they assimilate, but keep a lot of their own.
they are a few ethnicities, but all connected to the same land and legends. they are all slaves to due their home ethnicities being from Keremeloha, a large Inland steppe.
they united because of sympathy to each other. they are all under the same system, and similair cultures; they keep their old tribal identitiess still, their clan and ethnicity, but they form groups based on what slave culture they are from.
LGBTphobia is also non-existent in general, as if you serve the clan, you are good. they don't care whether you like their preffered genetalia
honestly, they do split in slave cultures. they are societies of slaves that ahve been separeted for millenia, so their language and culture is very different from their home one
and slaves currently aren't bought from keremeloha itself, but rather from the giant slave factories in Austeran
so an anime could be cool of the early days of the slave trade, but the later days are less wholesome and more hard labour
if its two slave communities connecting, nah. they don't do that. they are slaves
and the life of  slave? its boring.
they spend their day working, and in their spare time, spend in boring quarters, and often recite poetry because whyn't.
its fun.
for them at least
this is the average day of an average slave
slaves don't go to war, and war is rare af
like, in one millenium, there were 3 only
so yeah. not rally happenning
no drama
just work
and sometimes breaks for holy days and maternity leave
no paternity
very boring life

Given-name Personal-name patronymic matronymic clan-branch clan patriarch-name (title)
so:
Hasa Ituri Hasasel Imasel Yadof HaAnsi HaMolos HaMasataret
Ituri, birth name Hasa, son of Hasa and Ima, of the Yadof branch of the Ansi clan, born under the time of HaMolos(the title), the well-guided
parents are shown under their personal name, and patriarch;s under their titles
Given-name - by parents sometimes, or when young, before most other names gained
Personal-name - used by close people
patronymic matronymic - used only when in full name
clan-branch - used when reffering as a member of the clan-branch
clan - rarely used, mostly only when to contrast or to show full name
patriarch-name - same as clan
(title) - used by people below them, or to show the period of their life(thats why its used in patriarch-name)
its based from a strange familial culture. family and descent is everything, so to show it off is imporatnt. that is just for families where their names are shorter. for some, they have giant family trees inscribed in their names

turned a conworld symbol of mine into a cross
ironically, in this position, it represents the centre of the apocalypse and doom, or midwinter
its identically shown
the centre four-spoked thing, the Ziti쬬habbahi, represents the four stages/parts
when applied temporally, starting from the whole rectangle ant-clockwise, its summer/noon/peak, autumn/dusk/decline, winter/midnight/fall, spring/dawn/rise
and, the part at the top represets the main aspect
then, their a golden sun. thats the smaller circle at the bottom. that cycles around, and represents the minor aspect. the day and the year.
the aspect it applies to is what aspect it would be at if peak is at top.
many Anuziti쬬habbahi would have multiple suns, spinning around to show all the possible cycles.
will have a less blocky picture of one
it should be like a tiered thig with layers and pawns and spinning layers etc.
this is the original thing. the gold square is like a pawn, moving across, and the inner four-pronged thing is meant to be able to spin
![[Photos/topic/image-1.png]]
it has a similair origin (the inenr thing) to the swastika
this symbol is ancient
from 8k bGc to today. 14000 years
its become a symbol of a lot of stuff.
persevence, fate, eternity, cycle, the year, the year, the soul, earth, universe, the Asi캖an people(the people who first created it), history, time
its on the front cover, or at least hidden in the design) of every history book
basically, originally the centre symbol of four prongs evolved, of cycle, 4 stages etc.
then, some culture decided to use a stamp to keep track of how many cycles it was, as it was used as a glorified calendar]
the spinny thing is just a fancy calendar thing tbh.
it is imagined as cycling. going around and around. imagine seeing a picture of a water wheel as an example. it isn't spinning. but we think of it as spinning
it has one use as a calendar. not exclusively. its also used as a clockface,
yeah exactly
rather, looking at a symbol of eternity and be like "oh, Its death o'clock, not dying o'clock"
(thats legit how hours are named. 8 hours named after stages of life. warning: some cultures. not all. many ahve 24 hours)
## 10. Description of Clan system
An area of land is owned by a clan/branch of a clan. That land is a clanland. Each clanland has a clanhouse, a large communal building, which usually has a ritual space, housing, itenerant housing, and a communal forum. In the forum, people sell, buy, travel, advertise, etc.
The clan is ruled by a patriarch, him being the most senior or oldest man in the clan, but it can vary from culture to culture, i.e. Mogol clans use ultimogeniture, or the Godu culture can pass it to women too, but it cuts off there, so it passes down the male line.
If the clanland is large enough, it can contain houses placed throughout, in which branches of the clan can reside, or act as houses for itenerants, called landhouses.
The clanland is used to farm for rice for most clans, however other clans often herd animals, grow other plants, or only trade and governance, as they have small clanland. Clans are put in groups ruled over a clan in the area, 
## 11. Lao
Lao is the head deity of Old Orthodoxy, who came from a syncretisation of a river deity, \*La콄ya and a local substrate knowledge deity, who is unknown. He was originally a relatively minor deity, but during the time when agriculture came to prominance, he became a very important deity, and to represent many attributes which he gained. during this time, the Pa on his name was reanalysed as an epithet, giving us the modern term: Lawo.
Near the start of the CoTC, the religion started to be seen as more monotheistic, with Lawo being the head/only god, all other gods being offshoots of him.
He was instated as protector of the Empire by Takunuti Basoli, and the Emporer was seen as the embodiment of Lawo Bakasavi, Lawo the one who guards.
## 12. Bawala Sugar
Bawala Sugar is a type of sugar first developed in Anatolija Bawala. There exists a weed native to Anatolija Bawala, Sughra, that has enzymes in it can can break down cellulose and other such starches into simple sugars. In was used for millenia as medicine, as it relieved constipation, and as an herb, as it softens food via other enzymes. Sughra has a slight bitter-sour taste. When the colonisers kept extract from Sughra in wood containers, the wood became weaker, and the extract sweeter.
Via this discovery, they tested Sughra extract mixed with woodchips, and made a sugarwater like solution. They kept on using it in cooking, as it still has those mellowing qualities as plain Sughra extract. When distilled, the Sweet Sughra extract became a caramel like mass, and then became blocks of sugar which could easily be transported.
Today, it is made by mixing fine woodchips with a distilled version of the extract, then it is left and regularly mixed for a month, and then pressed to get the sugar sughra extract, then the sugar is distilled from that, packed into blocks, which are transported, however sometimes the simple sugarwater is taken, as a flex as its more expensive to take the sugar water than sugar blocks.

*15.19.1.1. Earliest history
The Amosi started as a group of the Damni, settling as a small agricultural community near the Taknunti River ~1400bGc, seemingly using the heavy floods as soil nutrient fortifiers. This gave the position of L칠wo, the river god, a greater position, and their subsistence on farming tied them to the small area by the rivers, however, they were able to trade heavily with many other communities, like the surrounding nomads, the Juscers.
They spread agriculture among the many other tribes, and they gained political power as by spreading grain from their rich soils; their main temple become a large communal centre of trade and living, being established in 854bGc by King Ijesakuci II, originally as Ejoliwe, today Greater Takunti, according to legend. During this time period, the Tribal system started to truly emerge, different clans uniting under tribal banners, and the Amosi tribe was formally established during this period.
*15.19.1.2. Tribal Period
Due to this, the oral geneology of the tribes explained the dominance of the Amosi, as their supposed patriarch, Amo, was the son of Damnar and his favourite wife, Eiorie, and due to this, they had the right to rule over the Damned tribes, and then, all tribes. This caused an escalation of power of the Amosi. During this time, the separation between the branches of the Damni linguistic family became more apparent, dialect continua breaking in the Tribal period. They still shared Proto-Central Damni with the Juscer people however. This made the Amosi think of the Juscer as a younger sibling, as during this time, the Juscer were settling down.
Around this time too, the Lucan Waseri peiod fell, causing a large influx of Lucan refigees from the north.

*22.1.1.1. Goisi's Early Life
룚isi, born 뤢욛isam칮nu, was born in 502 pDa, 19th of Mvodi, being the 6th son of Emperor Iroquwa the Steel and Empress Ejya of Igou. When he was 13, in 515 pDa, he was given the duchy of Paysi in the north east of the Empire, bordering his older brother뗩,  Guptan뗩 land. He saw the greater worth of his brother뗩, Be, northern lands, and he traded Paysi for Kasortu, which would become Old 룚isi. In 516 pDa, he discovered many water springs there, and founded six heliang mines, bringing many riches to him, as the land was mostly uninhabited.
In 519 pDa, he invited many refugees from Gant-Eloi, during the civil war. Due to his wealth, he was able to provide locations for the refugees, and he was able to establish himself as a king/theocrat of them. The people, who became known as Pre-Kanic 룚sans. Many sound changes in Bahri 룚san occurred during then, for example the reduction of most vowels, loss of voicedness distinctions, and loss of open started words.
*22.1.1.2. Start of a Nation
From 530 to 550, a migration of people from South-East Cypronxh into the south, concentrating the urbanising Old 룚isi, due to its status as a refugee haven, as they were escaping from the expanding Atlasids. They brought a large amount of different genes, and distanced the dialect from the standard Southern dialect, and brought in many foods that would become mainstays of the 룚san cuisine, such as dried meat sauces and Vaffenmi (melted dragon fat with spices).
During this time period, the many refugees that stayed developed a 룚san identity, and using the riches of the mines, 룚isi urbanised them, and due to the pre-existent semi-nomadic, they adopted raised, moveable houses. 룚isi standardised the houses to be hexagonal houses with 5.6m(3rt) long sides, with three stories, the uppermost one being a communal library/study room, so that in total every book is accessible, due to it being communal; the middle floor being bedrooms of the family. The lowest floor is a kitchen and entrance room, with an entrance at the centre of the floor, as most houses do. The total building is on stilts around 1.4m tall, with wheels, so that it can stay but be moved; called the Kazarim style. This still will be copied and altered by many nomadic agriculturalists, such as a majority of Thyaric cultures, many South Diqiwan and Ghatyean cultures, and Afriqyan cultures.
They also started domesticating and herding semi-domesticated Angel뗩 Death, becoming Qylyzanyz.
Due to the location of Old 룚isi, it was, alongside Be's lands, used as a buffer state between Gant-Eloi and the Taknitic heartland, and joining both the Gantic and Taknitic alliances in 19th Mvodi, 602, meaning that unlike Be, who decided to be thorn in both their sides, 룚isi allied with them, meaning the two couldn뗪 attack the other, and the alliances assured the military safety for the 룚sans, the 룚sans focused near exclusively on trading, farming, and scholarship.
*22.1.1.3. The Ten Castes
From 602 to 650 a ten caste system formed, based on three major professions, and their fame and riches. The three professions were Wata룣za, trader and merchant, Kywyza, scholar, religious leader and poet, and Tykyza, commoner and farmer; and the three ranks are high, mid and low, based on riches, merit and fame. This forms nine casts, with one more made based around 룚isi, who was the king, his family, and the surrounding people, representing a rank above high, and it's the only rank that contains a militaristic force of any kind, as to protect 룚isi and the court. Many people could move
between castes easily between the professions, or horizontally, like a normal job, and movement between rank, or vertical movement, is more difficult, as it necessitates the earning of fame, riches or merit in government. The castes are ordered and named in a way, to keep record keeping 
easy, each having a number, a name, and colour:
I-Kynytywyny쭃za-King and Court
II-WazaWata쭃za-Rich and Famous Merchants
III-WazaKywyza-Great and Notorious Scholars and Religious Leaders
IV-WazaTykyza-Fruitful and Rich Farmers and Commonfolk
V-료qywazaWata쭃za-Good to do Merchants and Traders
VI-료qywazaKywyza-Middle-Class Scholars, Religious leaders and Teachers
VII-료qywazaTykyza-Average and Common Farmer
VIII-료qyWata쭃za-Poorer Trader and Merchant
IX-료qyKywyza-Very Unknown Scholars and Teachers
X-료qyTykyza-Very average and Poorer Farmers and Commoners

****d. Unassorted
*d.1. Magic
magic can affect in any way, such as, if there is a religious belief of an inanimate object, the inanimate objects gets affected slightly. a similair, slighter effect can be done on people.
spirits are just collected up magic, smaller spirits collapses more easily, larger less. they can affect the real world. souls are just spirits stuck to a person, so it, for the lack of a better word, crystallises in a unique way.
magic can also be attached to objects, to exert a continuous force.
Most people can control specific forms of matter using elemental groups, earth, air, water, plant, metal and fire. the original one is earth.
*d.2. Roads
A common form of transport. usually walkable, or used with horse driven carriages. there exist roads, which once were only used for large destinations, but now are commonplace. they were always used, but trains, invented in 200 pGc, were first sued for the Wisuja(lit. people's road) which first stretched from Nuzw'ha, to Hambarkga, Takunuti and finally to a port leading to Alexandria. Train roads are made of uniform blocks made of clay, connected by oils, which emulsify the clay particles in the wet clay, and then connects it. Takunuti VII was famous for expanding the rail road system.
*d.3. Scripts
there exists the Xu /툮u/ script family, which originates from petroglyphs by the Lucan civilisation, and got spread around related languages. It is logographic. it has chinese aesthetics, and its very clunky. has two forms, stone and bamboo. bamboo is drawn with a brush on paper/wood/bamboo. stone script is much more circular, smooth, and representative of the idea; its carved on stone, and is much more simialir to the ancient petroglyphs.
the 콫u scripts are phonetic, and much more common. they sprouted around after the Xu scripts, to fit the much more complex languages around, and are still in common use, the most popular is the Ma script, invented by Emporer ???, in 504, to fit the languages of his minority peoples, due to the fact that the Xu script would fit it, and other 콫u scripts went extinct. it was used across the empire, as the only official 콫u script in the Taknitic empire.
*d.4. Taknunuti the Godly
The founder of the Taknitic clan, standardised the Xu script. He created the Taknitic empire.
The text already on his early life:
Birth date: 12th Linqi 7bGc
Death date: 28th Yel 103pGc
Spouse: Ye'e Tyruzsi
Born Ejizamo, he was born in the Hambarkga Palace, and was raised there in this
youth. In 1bGc, he moved to the Takunuti Palace, due to his father being crowned.
When he was 10, the Southern Genocide started. During this time, he was made
prince of Greater Anatolia, under regency of his uncles. On the 4th of Mvodi,
7pGc, at age 14, after his father's death, he was crowned as "Kunuti to Cawi".
In the next year, his army wiped out the Miitoe, and over 9pGc, he set up an
alliance with the Liaos, ramped up the production of weapons, and during this
time, the Hodtei tribe was split over the issue, the West Hodtei joining him,
and the East Hodtei joining the Galilean league, which ruled over the remaining
tribes. OIn the 19th Mvodi 10pGc, The Last Galilean War was waged, was lasted 10
days, wiping out the armies and camps of the remainign tribes, fully killing the
Alranites, Ghnna and a majority of the Samachian, East Hodtei and Vondhah tribes'
male lines. Many Vondhah, East Hodtei and Samachians fled northwards, into Liaos
lands. remaing Vondhah is their homeland were killed off over the enxt few years.
On 1st Linqi 13pGc, at age 20, he gained full control, and established the Amosi 
Kingdom as the Taknitic Empire, establishing himself as Takunuti, with the Liaos
regions being autonoumous.
On the 29th Yel, 14pGc, He had his first son, Ano, named after his close confidant,
Ano.
His title Takunuti means 'all-king', which was lexicalsied to hegemon, or emperor.
*d.5. Khaney Tribe History
The Khaney tribe immigrated across the Ney sea after the Waseri Lucan collapse
The Kanai tribe lived in what is now Kli Bagr, Macedona, and is the most distantly related to the other tribes. Supposedly, they were descended from Ondar, the eldest son of D캐sh, ergo the sub-ethnicity they belonged to was called the Ondraitou Sub-ethnicity. Due to its warm climate, it grew many fruits, such as the Bitter and Sweet Mu캚, many forms of Wild Melons, 캯ilk, a flower similar to lavender, and a unique form of rice called Cubbal, which has a dark blue colour, and a salty and sweet taste, such as a cracker. Due to the production of wild melons, it produced many high quality cloths, with beige colours, but white cloths still being made, but at lower amounts. They also make blue dyed cloths using Cubbal rice, usually costing 3.5 times more.
The language of the Kanai tribe was described ㄸs smooth As a table of marble, open as a doorrepresenting specifics by statatives, ownership, action and more by it. These could mean that it had liquid lenition and articles. With the use of other descriptions the first three lines of The Prophets translated into the Kanai dialect c. 150bGc is approximately   .
Their culture of sewing was highly important to them, as they had over 694 known types of looms, handheld looms were the most common, but uniform, with only 14 varieties, the majority of loom types were 땁tokke looms, used to combine the smaller cloths made by handheld looms. There were over 431 types that we know of. Due to how the handheld looms work, they visibly have repetitive rectanguloid shapes, called Kanami. Their most famous work is the Yu콮of To Aki which means approximately Joseph뗩 Greatest Work, probably being the name of the artisan or merchant who dealt with it. It was worn by the kings of the Kanai tribe, then the Amosi tribe for nearly 300 years. Yusuf To Aki was made of 16 paper thin pieces of cloth, with each Kanami made of different colours. The last king to wear it was Lan  [351-357]. Parts of The Yu콮of To Aki still exist, and are displayed in the Baghdad Museum. It was supposedly 8 metres long from top to bottom when worn.
Due to the distance of the Kanai tribe to the others, and due to the fact they were the only descendants of Kanai, the further western tribes saw them as barbarian-esque. This caused the distancing and the apathy to the things that occured to them, mostly by the more powerful central and western tribes. In the Pre-Genocidal Period, the travel of goods to and from Kanelai slowed, because of a drought in that area of West Anatolia, itself causing by the currents leading saltier waters to the rivers and coasts; making the colour of Cubbal Lilac became rarer, associated with Anatolia especially the eastern parts of it. By 17-6-94bGc, the  Kanai tribe was in such an economic state due to the decline of trade, that when the Amosi tribe invaded in their ploy to consolidate power, the Kanai tribe lost in 6 days. Their equivalent of a flag or a crest, which was pasted on their shields, was this:
The crown has the colour of their well-known Cubbal rice, which helped their populations throughout winters, and subsisted most of their exports through their history. The crown is turned on its side, to show how the royalty is non-absolute, and listens to its people and senate, unlike the nobility and monarchies of other tribes. The background is a beige colour, and that is the colour of the cloths they often make.
After losing the Kanai war, an overwhelming majority of the Kanai Population was enslaved by the Amosi tribe, the few that weren뗪 enslaved were the ones that intermarried into and from their royal family, such as Akara Ondriis, daughter-in-law of the Amosi king at the time. All the enslaved populus was used as free labour from the time period between 29-4-94bGc and 17-2-93bGc, the ones who were best at weaving, weaving intricate cloths, now remembered as Cloths of Blood, Toil and Death; the ones better at smithing and building used for projects with intense which involve physical labour, such as construction projects;, the unskilled children were used as either messengers, mill spinners, or sowers. The intelligent parts of the populus were used for tasks that included intelligence, such as letter writing, preservation of scriptures, designing of projects and more. The unskilled adults were used as cannon-fodder, mill spinners and farmers.
In the time period between 6-1-93bGc and 28-3-93bGc, a construction project which was built by the builders was finished, a cylindrical hall with a heavily heated floor, tilted towards the centre, covered in non-stick material, with a movable ceiling covered in hooks, and small watching area, from which you can access all the hooks. The project was 120 metres tall, and with a radius of 55 metres, all the walls being 2.4 metres thick, and the tilted floor at 17.5춿 downwards into a pit with a 12.54 metre diameter. During the time period, the enslaved populus of the Kanai tribe, who by then called themselves the Ondihkesi, were slaughtered, by slashing their entire bodies, and hanging them upside down on the hooks. The last Ondihkesi to die was a weaver girl called Isaafeu Ohkes, on the 28-3-93bGc, in the afternoon. The labour of the Ondihkesi stopped at 17-2-93bGc, as only 23.7% of their population remained, and preparations for the final slaughters were done.
Out of the blood of the slaughtered Ondihkesi, artisans and medics made a form of iron, now known as Kantui Buda. It has a reddish tint to it, and a beautiful shimmer. It is stored with the other irons of the nations in a bank in Irqii City, called Safe and Memorial to the Dead Nations of Dash. There were 11.4 kilograms of it produced.
*d.6. Structure of Early Empire
The empire is ceremonially ruled by the Taknitic Emporer, among three major rulers, the Alexandrian Macri, Lyaos Patriarch, and the Takunuti
They each control a realm within, the Macri controlled the Alexandrian City and Gahan, the Patriarch controlled the Lyaos area, and the Takunuti the rest of the empire. For one member to exert control over another area, they need permission from all three.
The Alexandrian city is split into neighbourhoods, and the Gahan as Cikheif칠dh콂u (also knowing afterwards) regions, in reference to keeping the rights of the Neo-Ghnna people, for them to know after death of the Ghnna.
The Takunuti's Land is split into clanlands, which are ruled by certain clans, or clan branches.
The Patriarch's land was split into many regions controlled by local lords, who went ditrectly to the Patriarch; the clan based system of the Takunuti's land got more popular in the Lyaos land.
Over time, the Gahan region got moved to the Takunuti's realm, leaving a handful of city states and the Alexandria region.
Takunuti was the capital, where administration was done, and taxes were held. This made the Takunuti region the most powerful.

*d.7. History of the Island of Ban
The island of Ban, named after its namesake discoverer, Ban, possibly being inspired off of the commander of the island's discovery, was discovered ~1400 bGc, by South Anatolic sailors. and then some East Anatolic settlers came, creating the unique phenotype. They spoke a South Anatolic language. Thta language was drivven to extinction by the Seda migration from further inland, who migrated from there all the way to Ban. they set up a large series of shepherding lordships, which slowly united into a few fiefdoms, which were, ~90 bGc, united under a high king under the influence of the Amosi, who didn't kill them, as they were seen as powerful allies, who could gaurd their new colonies. In 6 bGc, before the yearly celebartion of Storms, when every man of Banite clanship returns to Ban, a handful of pirates arrived and shelled parts of the coast. During the celebration itself, the cracks formed widened, and then split open, expunging scalding volatile gases across the whole island. due to the sudden loss in volume across the whole island, a giant earthquake occurred too. Due to the timely arrival of the storms, the volatile gases solidified into large formations of Bakhti, which had special properties, making it Banite stone. The volatile gases continued being expelled over the follwoing few thousand years, via cracks, and every few decades, following earthquakes occurred. In the autumn of 4870, a giant storm went over Ban, ridding the rest of the volatile fumes, and allowing settlement of the region.
*d.8. An ethnography of  Macedonans
The Macedonans emerged approximately ~3000pGe, descended from the South Dolans, staying in the many mountains of the areas, and continuing their pagan beliefs as the Gorean Invasions occurred across the rest of Thyaria.
They created many independent city states, and traded heavily with the neighbouring Ilian peoples, however, when the great fort city of Ilias fell, they mostly fled to Macedona.
They continued as tribalistic herders, using longhouses as clanhouses, continuing their beliefs in the mountains, partially settling in Western Anatolia.
Around 5000, the kingdom of Albania invade southwards into there, not managing to get further than Daisula, keeping a heartland for the Macedonans in Macedona proper, while many emigrated to Cypra and Domia, settling the airconter presence until today. During this time period, many more peoples came from West Anatolia, and The North West, from the Pangars.
The Albanian Kingdom fell apart, leaving many city states there, many of which reverts from South Gorean Orthodoxy to Macedonan Paganism. This formed a divergence ~5300, the northern form being more like the Gorean religion, the southern being more traditional, and the Islanders Islandering Islanderly.
In 5600-'700, the Santerranese kicked the door open and inveded them completely. They tried mass conversion, which caused mass migrations into Anatolia, however, manystayed and assimilated into Santerranese.
Under Governer M패eskaz팳, the culture of the Macedonans was crushed, the communal longhouses were converted into large Tempular Clanhouses, the use of idols in Macedonan Paganism was banned, and there were 63 different expeditions to try and invade the islands and the deep core of their heartland. Governer M패eskaz팳 ruled over the most of Santerranese rule, until Macedona's indipendence
He ruled from 5734 to 5821, his life's mission was to destroy the Macedonan culture. 
During the Indipendence, many older reffugees from Anatolia returned, and many crypto-Pagans reverted, producing a religious civil war from 5845-5803, which still has reprocusions. Currently, they are a republic and the fourth most pagan country in Thyaria.
Their current leader is Uu팯ndasse팶 Por(5990-), from the Islands, which just islanded as indipendent prncipalities for a few centuries
*d.9. Convo-1 [constantscript:off-topic 2/1/2023]:
Over the span of a few decades, the Amosi tribe wiped the other 23 tribes as well as it could off the map
10 were completely killed, their blood drained into iron slabs
7 were destroyed through war, their whole male population killed
5 outlived it, 3 of them barely, the other 2 being allies of the Amosi
The map, imagine, is that on the Middle East
The Amosi originate from just around Baghdad
They singlehangedly wiped out and occupied all of Anatolia, the Levant, and Sinai in the span of 30 years, utterly and completely wiped off the map
the Amosi was, in area, the smallest tribe
but, the most powerful and richest
WB
Its big
its just that like irl, civ starts in Middle East
[what is the most powerful country]: the Taknitic Empire
the successors to the Amosi, they rule dthe dawn of humanity
because, humans started in the Middle East practically, and started spreading out late.
well, either way, the Taknitic Empire is old
Uhh, more like is the Babylonians were older and survived to modern day in age, and culturally like a Sino-Semitic Mix
6005 years ago the Taknitic empire was founded, and according to legend, the Amosi were ~2000 years old at dissolluntion.
like Hinduism in Old Orthodoxy. One God many forms
however, many breakaways formed
[i see india united. is it also a monarchy or a democracy or something else?]
An empire
break away state of the China Kingdom
Because humans, who starting spreading from there from the Middle East circa 6000 years ago, came through Iran, then India, then into China
[are monarchies more common]: Yes, due to the clan structure
Diqiwo is an old kingdom, which came from Iran and spread eastwards, so it had a lot of breakaways
[democracies]: such as Ethiopia, Anatolia, and (kinda) Cypronxh

well, due to sociopolitics, it was a big, big, uneasy alliances of city-clanstates. poroks. they formed teh franconic leaugue, stretching from "Stockholm" to "Kent" at times, as its just a big trade agreement. then, it got invaded. they war rarely due to collective ancient trauma and society, but they are a giant ethnic and societal hotspot
but, trade is crucial, due to giant gorean migrations, which threw the balance of power very often, so they were a common binder
its a generally marshy land though. a wet, rainy, forested area, stretching to "Wales"
the Franconic Forest
Oh, Stockholm is an island that is sadder and wetter than England. also, they are not in power.
so, no, but, Finland and the rest of Sweden is cold and nice. still cold. the world is quite cold
yes. by a bit the hottest parts are only 35 C, and the coldest are -40, which are located in Northern "Canada" 
so yeah quite cold. idk by how much exactly.

why nearly the same as irl? laziness lol
I have many cultural analogs, but I cram them in to fit so violently that they become unique.  also, to make it separate everything has reasoning, which differs from irl. like the Cypronxhians, which are in the Caucasus, have a dynasty turn around faster than china. why? because mountains, age, and history
or the similairities are only skin deep. like the Dalai, who live where the Ganges would be. they look indian, but are very different, much more similair culturally to either the chinese or Japanese culturally than to irl indians
I bet the irl areas can be easily guessed
I'm currently curious how I'll do political maps because how land ownership works in my world is complex to say the least
huh. in my world, all the land is ceremonially owned the emporer. then it shared between sees, and those sees are split into kingdoms. the ruler of the see is elected form the kings, but usually isn't predecided. then kingdoms are split into provinces, all provinces techniaclly ruled and owned by the ruler of the kingdom, and teh ruler of a kingdom is "elected" from the province rulers. the same system goes down within the povinces, then within the region, which are subdivided in clanlands, ruled by clans.
usually, when members of two differnt clans marry, lands from the calns are given to the other clan as dowry, usually from the groom's side. but usually, its joint control, or just a ceremonial handing over.
its complex.
approx 1B
NETHERLANDS IS LIKE 5 SEPARATE ISLANDS
WHY DID I DO THAT
this is the base image that AUsteran (which in world is a slave factory 游 )
oh, it [suez canal] exists, but its underground
also, the route through the Fertile Crescent river is much more popular
from a river, to a giant temple, into another big river which passes straight through a giant market and capital city, then into very rich areas, and then out of the Persian Gulf
barely, because imagine song dynasty ships instead of industrial ships
also, it rarely used
the black route is much more efficient and much more practical. its has many big rivers and cities. the red route is only used to accessthat city just north of that big rive rthere. its a big city, but also over land trade to the black route so... the red route is basciaclly obsolete
btw, most tarde is from india and china into the middle east, then from europe to the middle east, meeting up there, mostly overland becaus eits much faster. or by train

ok. if humans start spread around 30,000 bGe, that means the population rises from the meager hundreds to like a few tens of thousands. They would spread north
all language families would start then. circa 28,000-20,000 bGe.
no. There are plans for it to be the first script language, so it has ancestors, so it way later. around 11,000 bGe maybe. very old
o, modern day is 6005 pGe. thats 36,005 years ago. each year is 360 earth days. so shorter, but old
ok. do you want continous use of the script until today? I can permit that via the Pawani conservatism
The ancient Koic petroglyphs of c. 12,500 bGe become a syllabary, and get semi-standardised c. 11,000 bGe. It slowly become the lhejwar script, which is kept standard by the Classical Koani from 1,000 bGe to 1,000 pGe. during that time is splinters, and becomes the many Pawani scripts

I have a very unique culture, the Pawani. They live in an asteroid like belt, living a nomadic, hunter gatherer lifestyle, very communal, very very old, where they live is very desolate and sparse. What sorts of creation myths could they have?
They have no sun. The comet band is over like a giant area (technically its a sphere) and on the edge are stars, and within in the sphere are stars, which have other planets.
Yes. Floating in the great cold winds. Like 40 mph, 5춿C winds. The asteroids are very sparse and usually icy or mostly desolate
They hunt the few animals and plants on the asteroids that exist. But, there are  enough asteroids, and depth
Hunter gathering is mostly extinct tbh, but they are very nomadic and collectivist
They use big ships, made of wessen leaves. Wessen is a very very very hardy grain. Theres also many species that are native there, such as Creperids and Enedri, large musclous lanky animals that travel and hunt much smaller animals. Kinda like filter feeders
Yes. Its like a desert. But cold and windy. Things such as small insexts can suspend
They mostly use larger asteroids to plant wessen, but wessen is very common. then gather it, and hunt some larger animals for meats. It seems desolate, but can develop complex ish ecosystems
Yes. They come from irl a small pocket near a ""river"", the ships came around and spread from a few hundred yo a few thousand
Just because they could irl.  Maybe to find others
Isolation is very important to them. They need eachother, so Isolation is a death sentence

A summary of the History of the Harab Valley, before the Century of Tribal Collapse: approx. 1400 bGc agriculture is started by many city states across teh Rivers, unifying the tribes. approx 1000 bGc writign emerges, originally logographic, but many smart people make phonetic ones. Some sort of collapse was around 600 bGc, causing many mass migrations, settling the Khaney tribe, etc. Then, the Amosi tribe started to gain much more power due to power over grain and rice. Thus, the nationalistic and supremacist tendencies caused teh Century of Tribal Collapse.

ah nice. for my world the year is 360 days long, and exactly 24 hours
partially to ease me, and them with calendars
they have prayer beads with 8640 beads, one for each hour of the year
and they have basically smaller coils of 12, to keep track of the duodecimally counted cycles of years.
There are many traditions from the Harabban Empire (or is it Taknitic? eh. doesn't matter) which are older than the Clan reforms. Like the duodecimal numerology. It was used for years, land plots and timetelling
after the clan reforms most things became decimal, but those things stayed base-12. 
The Century of Tribal Collapse affects stuff again.
they... honestly don't care. the priests have week long mantras too
they deal with excessively long practices. it is to practice the eternity and completely of their gods
but, during mass migrations, quite a few of the original mantras were lost completely, the Mantra of The Poor, The Eternal Tradition(very ironic), and teh Mantra of the 600 tribes
The mantra of the poor: a collection of every possible way to die if poor and destitute

The eternal tradition: a giant portmanteau of every word and name possible. All names had to be in the eternal tradition; after its loss there was... A hig religious decable

The mantra of the 600 tribes: a genealogy

The Noumeidi-the only hunter-gatherers of Oreidica. The Noumeidi developed hunter-gathering, via isolation in the deep cold forests of Noumeidi, ~4000-4500, when the temperature was much colder. they developed fire magic to combat the harsh cold, and many rituals to fight it. many have been 'civilised' by the northern Nousse Kingdom, many taking the clan name Noumeidertys 'the opposers of the Noumeidi'.

for my world, it does slightly. because souls exist, and they basically have two options: reincarnation or bliss via meeting thee goddess of death. its chosen based on morals and beliefs. but, if also a slight law: if a soulless object is treated by souls as revered, it will become slightly revered
souled object can have the same effect, but its much slighter
your body can't be without your soul. if do that, congrats, you get an unkillable zombie
the soul is preservatory force, without it, your body is likea piece of meat.
and, aging is just your soul detaching
sudden death is when the body is beyond repair, so the soul can't do anything, so just, Vanatyza Jyza I guess
like car crash
Vanatyza Jyza is a common exclamation. Good death, referiing to the goddess of death
so, like, back pain is just your back becoming souless
now, souls can exit bodies for short periods of time, when in some deep prayer or meeditation. so, iff you are killed then, your body is dead, but your sould is till attached. however, you can't die twice, so... immortality
the men of cloth? they were something to fight.
usually to continue the connection to the body and soul, the body was chopped into many protected pieces, then connecte dot wire like machine of wooden spires, covered in fireproof, softened silks. They were unkilleable during the Hanoi War, of after the Hanoi Kingdom was plunged into the sea

nope. the logography was made to fit a very specific analytic language family. that didn't work for otehr language families. they weer in contact with other languages and scripts, so they made them. its like trying to smash nuhalk into hanzi

It is BIG big. like, that language I showed, it has a whole dramatic backstory, golden age, and fall
the Samarians are the few survivors of a pan-ethnic genocide
they huddled with the Ponts in the small Liao lands, and stayed unidentified for a hundred years, were obscure from the Empire for another 400, until the Atlasic people of North Irquii started to migrate northwards, when a king, D친콑c콠nt칲jo 칀풪sam칢r칲拷꼋칬/Dash the Samar, led then into Old Goisi.
irquii is named after Iroquwa the Iron, who wa sthe king that restarted the Golden Age of the Taknitic Empire
it is the name of the heart of the Taknitic League
but, more historically, the Santerranese.
They took over all of Europe successfully.
they had colonies from Iceland to Tajikistan
they were the napoleon
according to them, North America is geographically europe
yes
the have no pacific
so, peopel came from the north, from Europe, or Thyaria, as they call it
only, people there live long
the average is 150 years
for example, Laoz, is the oldest person..  he is ~5500 years old
he is the second hand source for everything
when I say everything
I mean everything
he met people who lived during the reign of king Dayan, who lived only 300 years after the first legendary person in the world
a small summary though: The first people with accurate records for are the 24 tribes, whoi lived ~200 bGc. Then big genocide by the Amosi. It was tragic. I can give the story of one tribe, but it's a horror beyond words. Then, Takunti the Godly and his demi-goddess wife created the Taknitic empire. Writing, law, and language were standardised. after Takunti I's death, the survivors of the Genocide showed up in the far north.
Then, the golden age of Takunti I fell, the last major contribution being industrialisation.
Stuff, occured for 300 years, when a great-grandson of an emporer declared the second country ever in the north, the Cypronxhians. It, occurs. Then, 100 after that, a golden age, mass migration, a distant ethnic dies out due to too much oxygen(long story). Laoz and Goisi are born. Thwe south unifies, the survivors are pushed into said south, and Goisi and the survivors, called the Pont-Samari, travel into the south of the south. another empire, the DAo empire, pushes into India, and the Cypronxhians first push into Europe.

yep. Basically, slave can only be: children or granddchildren of slaves or b. Keremelohans 游
Keremeloha is basically Central Asia
and due to that, East Ghatye started importing and breeding the best slaves, but also intermarried, making basically enslaved natives
called the Dala slaves
now, because it got them fabulously rich, they decided to use the empty, lush, new island nearby(Australia) to send slaves from all around, to make a slave factory
and a ginormous church
which they were the priessts of
Also some Dala slaves were chucked into Alaska, forming the second black ethnicity
because indonesia was just starting to be. It barely needed slaves
slaves were used for building and ships
So it didn't have any native slaves
Also, it was a giant warzone
Slaves were being deported back into Keremeloha willingly
Because an empire from the east blasted on the scene, freed the slaves, intermarried, and then invaded into Keremeloha, dropped them off, and created the Greater Gosans
thus, mechanism was necessary in Diqiwo and Goisi, so the industrial revolution started in 4800, but slowly and mostly in Goisi, because Diqiwo got them cheap slaves(like a galley for 300 ish pounds) 
a galley is 50 people
6 pounds a person
but, prices vary depending on origin
but, they all share in common: their language, culture, and some Keremelohan ancestry

like the central bottom by the big river mouth
the people found out that pigs exist around 3444
then they made pork
and pork was a very influential thing in their cultrur
and their cuisine is based on pork based dishes, marination and sauce sbeing used
Plebian

best part: due to how civilisation works there, noones poor, so not lowerc class
its based a strange system of clan based trade and subsistence
due to a war somewhere else, radio was invented, so now they can sell better
everythings an ad
because there are clans which own certain areas around them, on which most farm and herd. Then they trade in the ginormous clanhouse halls. then trains, footpaths, and magic paths connect clanhouses
clans are ran by family, so it might seems to objectify women, but no, it objectifies everyone
"once you old enough to pick rice, you go to the fields"
or hold a sign
thats a job that kids mostly do
everythings rice
meat depends on where you live
dragon meat is mainland chinese food for example
while the richest areas eat duck
duck as it links the river, land and sun
but as it flies rarely, its cooked. so a cooked (smoked too) duck is very symbolic and holy
meanwhile some guy is just screaming poetry at his radio

in my world, the Hanoi people just are everywhere the come from the prosperous Song area, and then exploded out into Arabia, and off from there
like just they are literally 20% of the world population. thats not a lot in just number, but the world is sprcely populated so
they are populous
they spread via religion, and few are pur Hanoi. becasue they were Hanoi, spread into Arabia, and mixed. then they spread out further
like Arabs. if they started in South China and then travelled into Arabia
Like, the Hanoi people are native to Song, basically South China. then a prophet brought them to Arabia via India. many stayed across the migration, and many grew and mixed into the Arabian population. then, they spread out via proselatysation

also, in my world, the guy that ochestrated the genocide of the Khaney, King Ejawi, his son-in-law was a khaney prince.
so, much irony. that prince was the brother of the last khaney king.
mind you, all khaney clanmembers outside of marriage sto royal family were rounded up, then enslaved, tortured, and then drained of blood to make whips with which they were whipped. the spoiler is there for a reason btw
exactly
so yeah.... a similair process was carried out on other tribes. except the Ban tribe. their island just exploded
more like a gas leak, then a match being struck and the island was shattered, covered itself and surrounding areas in a hard, white, marble like stone, killing every banite. oh, and every single one, because it happened during a banite holiday

my world has only rice
no barley
no wheat
true
I am trying to make outlandish things out of rice, but east asia already beat me
rice paper? rice stew? rice ink? done already
also, my dog eats lots of rice too
also, if you white rice, then indians brown rice
Also, with that khaney prince marrying into the royal family, that means that the future kings are ethnically part of an ethnivity they exterminated
like the fuhrers being part jewish
yes.  the right part is the khaney part, the right line being the emporers, and the circled guy being the exterminator. they are more closely connected by a different marriage though
your reaction is correct
mind you, all the kings there were part of the xtermination, but just of different ethnicities. like the the emporer at the bottom exterminated the Gahana, while being 1/64th Gahana himself
*d.25. Convo-18 [Your Average CA-27 Avon Sabre 4/3/2023]:
In Asu Delusaye(my fictional World) theres an ancient dynasty of the Taknitids. They trace over 6000 years back, in power for nearly all of those years
They could in theory, by legend, trace 2000 years further back
from Dasa to Takunuti LXXXIX
so yeah. much power
maybe like 5 [years out of power]
so yeah. very very poerful
and big

the oldest evidence of modern humanity in my world is a 53,000 yo stone post. It is a grave that was lost in a storm.
Its old. there are older settlements, but they are of a slightly different species, which are ~300,000 yo
my world has a messed up biohistory
Homo Australodomus
Ethiopia to Georgia
but, a closely related species did get to Australia
its called Homo Sapiens
but, Anatolia has tons of human evidence. from thousands of mounds and skeletons, to being the urheimat to possibly every extant language family and origin of modern humans.
they didn't get into Europe.
because of the Gorgonids.
they didn't go north because cold and sea and nope. they didn't go east becasue mountain, and south because plague
so they stayed in the middle east.
ok. well, due to that, humans stayed tucked into the Middle east (mostly) until a much of land reforms 5500 years ago, allowing long term migrations.
and from 10,000-5000, a weather shift occured, making the gorgonids go basically extinct, warming the steppes up, and increasing the floodplains of Middle eastern rivers
thus, the population and civilisation exploded, so migration was possible and necessary
*d.27. Convo-20 [Your Average CA-27 Avon Sabre 20/3/2023]:
for my world: there are 3 holidays which are consistent, because the calendar is so obvious that to not is dumb. 360 days per year, moons goes around every 20 and 30 days.
*d.28. Convo-21 [Your Average CA-27 Avon Sabre 1/4/2023]:
I am thinking: because their symbolic generation is 24 years, their creation year would be 3,590 bGc, 150 generations from the  Galilee battle. They have an oral tradition of Dash and his kin, so that would play in. maybe 1790 bGc, 75 generations ago. before that they could say that the generations were longer, or, as their historians would guess, the ages were counted in lumar months or seasons.
so instead of a generation being 280, or 100 years, it would mean 23, or 25 years
*d.29. Convo-22 [Friends of The Schwa:conworlding 18/4/2023]:
the centre four-spoked thing, the Ziti쬬habbahi, represents the four stages/parts
when applied temporally, starting from the whole rectangle ant-clockwise, its summer/noon/peak, autumn/dusk/decline, winter/midnight/fall, spring/dawn/rise
and, the part at the top represets the main aspect
then, their a golden sun. thats the smaller circle at the bottom. that cycles around, and represents the minor aspect. the day and the year.
the aspect it applies to is what aspect it would be at if peak is at top.
many Anuziti쬬habbahi would have multiple suns, spinning around to show all the possible cycles.
it should be like a tiered thig with layers and pawns and spinning layers etc.
this is the original thing. the gold square is like a pawn, moving across, and the inner four-pronged thing is meant to be able to spin
[image-1]
yes.
it has a similair origin (the inenr thing) to the swastika
its become a symbol of a lot of stuff.
persevence, fate, eternity, cycle, the year, the year, the soul, earth, universe, the Asi캖an people(the people who first created it), history, time
its on the front cover, or at least hidden in the design) of every history book
basically, originally the centre symbol of four prongs evolved, of cycle, 4 stages etc.
then, some culture decided to use a stamp to keep track of how many cycles it was, as it was used as a glorified calendar]
the spinny thing is just a fancy calendar thing tbh.
it is imagined as cycling. going around and around. imagine seeing a picture of a water wheel as an example. it isn't spinning. but we think of it as spinning
it has one use as a calendar. not exclusively. its also used as a clockface,
looking at a symbol of eternity and be like "oh, Its death o'clock, not dying o'clock"
(thats legit how hours are named. 8 hours named after stages of life. warning: some cultures. not all. many ahve 24 hours)
*d.30. Info Dump
Cewoga Lawo is the proper name for the head deity of the Old Orthodox religion. It is sacreligious to utter that name, and can only be uttered by the emperor or high priests during the coronation, or the 3 high festivals; The Days of Rains, Harvest, and Death.
huh. in mine, the imperial family are vessels for incredibly powerful spirits, and with the high priests, they formed a society, ehich controls all information, records and is near all-powerful.
theres a plant that produces so much pollen, it clogs the respiratory tract of people there. Imagine seeing a flower, checking what it smells like, and then choking to death.
the santerranese empire didn't take the Nuzwhic Empire and Shandi
and the Nuzwhic Empire was just a puppet state (콭o Dynasty) so...
if you act as a man, you are one. if you act s a woman, you are one. if you act as a farmer, you are one
gender only acts a method to understand positions of inheritance and marriage
for them it was just: women marry to men, and men usually gain inheritance. that was the main thing. before, if you could work, you did
humans were few in number and had a small range. the land was new, wild, and needed to be used. thus, they all worked.
also, a cool conworld thing: clans. clans keep together always. blood runs thick. due to the fact they exist in every society, and trace themslevs, they form decentralised kingdoms, kept by each clan working together. a clan is just a usually patrilineally related family, which could be just a dozen or so people in a small valley, or hundreds in great palaces.
they also often grouped up into a 'porok' which are just small sets of clans, so that they can be stronger. then poroks wouls group together via trade.
a downside of the clan system is that people without clans can really gain support structures. so if you were plopped in the conworld, you wouldn't be able to gain help, unless you form a clan, become a priest, or join clans as mediators or iterant workers.
the clan system keeps groups together, and as it originally ruled over them, all of them pay lip service (and taxes) to the emperor. thusly, money and clout, as they descended from incredibly powerful monarchs
The Taraq Civilisation seems to be an advanced society, which farmed on the mountaintops of the Tariq mountains, ~3000bGc.
They seem to have invented the calendar, been the first to settle in Hambarkga, and might have been the ancestors of the Seda,
falling and migarting away after a series of heavey storms and earthquakes, and a mass migration shown by archeology from East Anatolia
deep southwards, into the areas of the Seda urheimat.
in my conculture, they can chose a personal name, as it is theirs
an ethnicity that is enslaved, and they keep together exclusively by culture.
they are the only enslaved ethnicity
they are closed, as they are a slave class, but basically, anyone that can speak their language, and recite their poems, are Exkeremelohans too
they are the only slave class. some groups have been spearated from their homes and typical society for millenia. they assimilate, but keep a lot of their own.
they are a few ethnicities, but all connected to the same land and legends. they are all slaves to due their home ethnicities being from Keremeloha, a large Inland steppe.
they united because of sympathy to each other. they are all under the same system, and similair cultures; they keep their old tribal identitiess still, their clan and ethnicity, but they form groups based on what slave culture they are from.
LGBTphobia is also non-existent in general, as if you serve the clan, you are good. they don't care whether you like their preffered genetalia
honestly, they do split in slave cultures. they are societies of slaves that ahve been separeted for millenia, so their language and culture is very different from their home one
and slaves currently aren't bought from keremeloha itself, but rather from the giant slave factories in Austeran
so an anime could be cool of the early days of the slave trade, but the later days are less wholesome and more hard labour
if its two slave communities connecting, nah. they don't do that. they are slaves
and the life of  slave? its boring.
they spend their day working, and in their spare time, spend in boring quarters, and often recite poetry because whyn't.
its fun.
for them at least
this is the average day of an average slave
slaves don't go to war, and war is rare af
like, in one millenium, there were 3 only
so yeah. not rally happenning
no drama
just work
and sometimes breaks for holy days and maternity leave
no paternity
very boring life

Ituri, birth name Hasa, son of Hasa and Ima, of the Yadof branch of the Ansi clan, born under the time of HaMolos(the title), the well-guided
parents are shown under their personal name, and patriarch;s under their titles
Given-name - by parents sometimes, or when young, before most other names gained
Personal-name - used by close people
patronymic matronymic - used only when in full name
clan-branch - used when reffering as a member of the clan-branch
clan - rarely used, mostly only when to contrast or to show full name
patriarch-name - same as clan
(title) - used by people below them, or to show the period of their life(thats why its used in patriarch-name)
its based from a strange familial culture. family and descent is everything, so to show it off is imporatnt. that is just for families where their names are shorter. for some, they have giant family trees inscribed in their names

turned a conworld symbol of mine into a cross
ironically, in this position, it represents the centre of the apocalypse and doom, or midwinter
its identically shown
the centre four-spoked thing, the Ziti쬬habbahi, represents the four stages/parts

will have a less blocky picture of one
it should be like a tiered thig with layers and pawns and spinning layers etc.
this is the original thing. the gold square is like a pawn, moving across, and the inner four-pronged thing is meant to be able to spin
[image-1]
it has a similair origin (the inenr thing) to the swastika
this symbol is ancient
from 8k bGc to today. 14000 years
its become a symbol of a lot of stuff.

*b.31. Description of Clan system
An area of land is owned by a clan/branch of a clan. That land is a clanland. Each clanland has a clanhouse, a large communal building, which usually has a ritual space, housing, itenerant housing, and a communal forum. In the forum, people sell, buy, travel, advertise, etc.
The clan is ruled by a patriarch, him being the most senior or oldest man in the clan, but it can vary from culture to culture, i.e. Mogol clans use ultimogeniture, or the Godu culture can pass it to women too, but it cuts off there, so it passes down the male line.
If the clanland is large enough, it can contain houses placed throughout, in which branches of the clan can reside, or act as houses for itenerants, called landhouses.
The clanland is used to farm for rice for most clans, however other clans often herd animals, grow other plants, or only trade and governance, as they have small clanland. Clans are put in groups ruled over a clan in the area, 
*b.32. Lao
Lao is the head deity of Old Orthodoxy, who came from a syncretisation of a river deity, *La콄ya and a local substrate knowledge deity, who is unknown. He was originally a relatively minor deity, but during the time when agriculture came to prominance, he became a very important deity, and to represent many attributes which he gained. during this time, the Pa on his name was reanalysed as an epithet, giving us the modern term: Lawo.
Near the start of the CoTC, the religion started to be seen as more monotheistic, with Lawo being the head/only god, all other gods being offshoots of him.
He was instated as protector of the Empire by Takunuti Basoli, and the Emporer was seen as the embodiment of Lawo Bakasavi, Lawo the one who guards.
*b.33. Bawala Sugar
Bawala Sugar is a type of sugar first developed in Anatolija Bawala. There exists a weed native to Anatolija Bawala, Sughra, that has enzymes in it can can break down cellulose and other such starches into simple sugars. In was used for millenia as medicine, as it relieved constipation, and as an herb, as it softens food via other enzymes. Sughra has a slight bitter-sour taste. When the colonisers kept extract from Sughra in wood containers, the wood became weaker, and the extract sweeter.
Via this discovery, they tested Sughra extract mixed with woodchips, and made a sugarwater like solution. They kept on using it in cooking, as it still has those mellowing qualities as plain Sughra extract. When distilled, the Sweet Sughra extract became a caramel like mass, and then became blocks of sugar which could easily be transported.
Today, it is made by mixing fine woodchips with a distilled version of the extract, then it is left and regularly mixed for a month, and then pressed to get the sugar sughra extract, then the sugar is distilled from that, packed into blocks, which are transported, however sometimes the simple sugarwater is taken, as a flex as its more expensive to take the sugar water than sugar blocks.
*b.34. Tyruz
Tyruz was a Lucan sun god, who was a high level god in the Lucan mythology, but below their version of Lawo. He had a major temple in Hambarkga in the Lucan era. He had a major preistly family, dedicated to him, the Tyruzsi. The most influential member of it is Jeke Tyruzsi, who was married to Takunuti the Godly.
*b.35. Takunuti Clan
The Takunuti Clan is a major clan in Oreidica, being descended from Takunuti the Godly and his close patrilineal relatives. They are influential due to their noble and royal connections, and clout.
*b.36. Pawan
The Pawan is the edge of the universe, it is one of the most inhostpitable regions. It is an asteroidal area, with is sparse and barren in resources. It is occupied by the Pawani, a native people group, that have lived for over 56,000 years, due to archeological records
*b.37. Mushrooms
Mushrooms generally are used for food, so they aren't studied as a science, but rather as a culinary art, usually transmitted via mothers of the clan
*b.38. ?
a common tradition was basically to send a man of the family, marry him to a princess, then marry the child further up, then that child's child further up
*b.39. Taknitic to Anatolic Atlasic

23Akeminowatepa, ate all Adesathi, all to fill Dzhair, he started to gnaw Dzhair. 24But Lao, felt the wrong, and sent a prophet into him, to stop the evils. 25An Adesathi crafted by Lao뗩 hand, with the name of Takunti, and now it was good. 26A man with a snake tail, alongside fair white and deep black hair. 27As Lao saw it was good, so he made a staff of unimaginable weight. 28He said to Takunti Go out and break through Akeminowatepa, for he is an evil 29He then said You shall be the kings of a new world, and the father and mother of all 30As soon as the last word was spoken, the strength of Lao was imbued in him. 31The chalk-skinned man, the first angel, he struck the clear jade bone of Akeminowatepa. 32The clear jade cracked, killing the grand beast, for one, shattering him to pieces. 33The staff combined with the bone broken, making the greatest weapon in the face of Lao 34Lao saw it, and saw that it was good, and made it to Nir, the very will of the Universe. 35Akeminowatepa, near all dead, except for their jade soul which was split to 8 parts. 36Besi, Aozheo, Yooko, Dzer, Shazaozh, Xachi, Ati and Oithe. 37As Lao saw that all Dzhair can fester, and no such great evil as Akeminowatepa. 38Dzhair was split into 12 realms, Loka and Heaven by Lao, Loka soulful and metaphysical, for Chnothare. 39And Heaven physical, a grand mountain of Lao with a sea of milk covering it, all with angels and Chamsazesi 40Six kinds of Angels, Epheiiani, a beast with four heads, a man's, cat's, bull's and a hand with an eye, a snake tail and six hands with eyes and ears 41Recht콄i, which are chickens of marble, which have a man's head with one large ear and eye on the face. 42Warathai, tall emaciated men with chalk skin, and a robe for legs and wings, with a beasts face on the head's back, covered by a veil 43Jiann캡, a wing for the torso, and a large eye below the head, which isn't there, the arms long, and the left has a scythe. 44칁no픦i, a plated wing covered in eyes, with a large eye on the wrist, and a claw with an ear on it. 45Omei, a gold ring covered in eyes, with a hand with an eye on the palm and an ear on the wrist. 46The final, Chamsazesi, a minor angel, men with legs of a snake, and wings with eyes all over. 47Loka was sent opposite to Heaven, with holy gateways, between the realms, 48Takunti was given two realms too, and They were linked with Heaven. 49They were made in form of eachother, Chath and Dshar. 50The gateway between Dshar and Heaven more open than for Chath.
#### Chapter 2
1For here is Dshar, and this is what has been told by the prophets, and this is what has been told. 2The carcass of Akeminowatepa, made into Takunti's realms. Evil redeemed 3The bones, earth. The blood, water. The teeth, stones. The eyes, sun and moon. 4But out of Dzhair, two gods were born, Fanti, and Biw. An extension of Lao's will, as all gods. 5Fanti, the shepherdess of the dead, a veiled dark lady, calming the minds of the dead. 6The minds pasting a tapestry of stars in her veils, giving an excelling light. 7Comforting the dead, and her daughter Sommi, comforting the living with sleep. 8Biw, the god of shadows, who took the unrestable minds, and allowed them to scream. 9Now as dreams and nightmares, as Sommi is his wife. 10And as Takunti formed Akeminowatepa into Chath and Dshar, 4 gods were born from the act. 11Chtam, the goddess of the earth, made of the bones of Akeminowatepa. 12Iona, god of water, formed from the blood of Akeminowatepa 13Essan, goddess of jade and stone, formed of the teeth of Akeminowatepa 14D콈, god of the sun, moon and stars, made of the eyes of Akeminowatepa 15All gods are of their lines. Of Fanti, Sommi, Biw, Chtham, Iona, Essan and D콈.
#### Chapter 3
1To shape the earth, Takunti summoned 14,270 Jiann캡, to create the seas, mountains and deserts. 260 defied the law of Lao, forming the First Titans; their children with Chtham being the beasts of the Earth. 352 were made by Lao into the plants, the trees, grasses, fruit, while they saw, but they children after that were stupid 47 remaining, the first made mother of clouds, spinning clouds from the ice of Cold Hell, burning up into smoke and crying. 5The second and third, sent to carve the caves of the earth 6The fourth, wove stone into precious stones and gems, crazing and polishing them with a mildly warm silk cloth 7The fifth, manifesting as fire, burning in pain as ash. The sixth, carrying and guiding the winds and birds. 8The final one, Keoiredneiro, Close Gate, was made to drape the dusk and dawn with his blood, into reds and blues. 9The beasts were seen by Lao, and he spoke to the Jiann캡. 10Redeem all beasts in this realm, sons of Dzhiunesiro, and devote them to me. 11And they did so, as he spoke, but the daughter of Keoiredneiro, Ishachih, was taken by Takunti. 12She was 6 tands tall, with hooves for feet, skin as smooth and white as milk. 13Her children with Takunti, Old Titans, half a simlli tall, stewards in the earth, skin like the stone of the earth. 14The Old Titans, after many years, only a few truly remained with Lao, faithfully. 15Over many generations, many, many years. Takunti came down as Laothzi, and Ishachih as Isha'e, and made a new race of men 16The New Titans were 2 tands tall, with clay coloured skin, picking the Cohhi, in those old forests 17The followed Lao faithfull, dedicating the north to them, the holy akromelanos. 18Once, a New Titan, Pavul, was praying by a lake in Akromelanos, and a ghostly figure appeared to him. 19The aspect of Lao said You are with me, to a new people, your eldest son will the first Man. Pavul went home, after praying. 20Years after, Pavul뗩 son, Mesehan, went to pray at a lake in Acromelanos, the ghostly figure appeared to him. 21렟ou are the founder of my people, you will lead them to a new era, As the aspect finished, the last Old Titan died. 22Over three half hundred years, he had three sons, Sapein, Zimesh and Sofon. Sapien went to the north of Akromelanos, while Zimesh went to the south of it. Sofon remained with Mesehan. The south lake led to Chath, while the northern lake went to Dshar. 23The sons of Sapien spread across Dshar, ㄸd치n between the rivers, Hoden to the cold mounts, Annasi for the land of wild horses, Menlik for heat, Tenpeo for the lands of rivers 24Many others were all over, from Sapien뗩 line. A few from Zimesh, founding a city, named after his homeland, Akromelanos.25The men were many, so land was unplentiful, and the king with Zimesh; southwards into the plains and hills of the lagoons, rivers and Hkolin. 26Many rulings, dukes, in the south, one was called D캐sh, through Zimesh뗩 son Fenci. He was in Lao뗩 favour. 27He was told, in his old age, that the land in the South will be a sea, a mount left to see.

He knew, bringing much in his voyage to the fertile land. 28Many rices and fruit, his slaves and followers, his relatives. A boat of red lacquer, and white stone.

29They took Zimesh뗩 grave, a relic of all their times and kings, to the set out mount, buried with a beautiful mausoleum, like his ship. 30As the sea entered, the many died, but him, and the crowds left out of the forest, the rice was like an arrow for them. 31The anterage of D캐sh first landed in a land of dry sands and mounts, and the dry isles. Once the got to a strait, where you could swim across, Lao spoke to him: 32 Here you are, seeing at both ends. The trees are rich, not in money now, but green as I painted them. 33All they cried to him O Lao, you have given us a new land! 34The descendants of his spread throughout the land given to him, 24 tribes, through his sons and theirs. 35All seen and cared by Lao. He sees them with his angels, gods eyes. 36D캐sh뗩 sons, Ondar, Aiar, Set, Elim, Meach. Through Ondar, the Kanai. 36Through Set, Anach, ancestor of Isaar, and Alarn, father of the Lamni and Sennai. Through Elim, like with Set, The Ochites, Samarians, Liyaocca. 37Through Meach the Young, The Plenty arose. Two Sons, Aber and Ismalle. Ismalle뗩 Son, Ban, went south and found an isle. 38Fair and untrodden, He blessed. 39His Lines split in two, one further east, back to shore. Aber married his paternal aunt, Ena. Through her, three sons. Loxon, Ain, Saen. 40Saen with Ama, of Ismalle, had a son, Dom, through whom the Domites came; and a daughter, Eali, wife of Ain. 41She had two sons: Emas, and Pont. Emas, as a child, was in a garden with Aone뗩 son, Irads. The nuckiferberries weren뗪 ripe, and the young Irads was foolish. 42As he was aiming at firlets, he saw Emas, and threw at him. The blow blew him to The lily gardens of Mesehan, without a soul in their realm. 43Irads was seen by a Warathai, and he made Irads a great monument, to punish him, alive. 44As Pont came to the garden, he saw his brother there laying, dead.
