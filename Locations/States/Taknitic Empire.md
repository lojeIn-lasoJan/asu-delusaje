# History
## Founding
The Taknitic Empire was started in 10pGc, during that years days of Floods. It originally was just what would be considered the [[Harabban Empire]], and not even all of it, with the Galillee confederation in the south east.
It was formed under [[People/Takunuti the Godly|Takunuti the Godly]] as a symbol of unity of the Amosi Kingdom and its colonies.
## Battle of [[Gaja Flats]]
The first major battle of the Empire was the Battle of Gaja Flats, within the north of the Gaja Flats, a marshy area where the rivers split and flow into the sea.
The Taknitic army has formed around the [[Galille confederation]] area pushing out camps, and killing as many as they could find, making all of them flee into the camps in the Gaja Flats, still with backup routes leading out in case.
On 16/4/10bGc, the battle occurred. The Taknitic Empire won by 22/4/10bGc, thats when the fighting was finished. The main part of the camp was burnt, and all the men, sons, and pregnant women were kept as prisoners of war.
They were kept within the Gaja Flats, and were made to build the starts of the port there, which became the modern Gaja district of [[Eli]]. 
## Unification
