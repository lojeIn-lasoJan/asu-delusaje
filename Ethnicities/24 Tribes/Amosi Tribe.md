# History
## Early history
The Amosi started as a group of the Damni, settling as a small agricultural community near the Taknunti River ~1400bGc, seemingly using the heavy floods as soil nutrient fortifiers. This gave the position of LÃ©wo, the river god, a greater position, and their subsistence on farming tied them to the small area by the rivers, however, they were able to trade heavily with many other communities, like the surrounding nomads, the Juscers.
They spread agriculture among the many other tribes, and they gained political power as by spreading grain from their rich soils; their main temple become a large communal centre of trade and living, being established in 854bGc by King Ijesakuci II, originally as Ejoliwe, today Greater Takunti, according to legend. During this time period, the Tribal system started to truly emerge, different clans uniting under tribal banners, and the Amosi tribe was formally established during this period.
## Tribal period
Due to this, the oral geneology of the tribes explained the dominance of the Amosi, as their supposed patriarch, Amo, was the son of Damnar and his favourite wife, Eiorie, and due to this, they had the right to rule over the Damned tribes, and then, all tribes. This caused an escalation of power of the Amosi. During this time, the separation between the branches of the Damni linguistic family became more apparent, dialect continua breaking in the Tribal period. They still shared Proto-Central Damni with the Juscer people however. This made the Amosi think of the Juscer as a younger sibling, as during this time, the Juscer were settling down.
Around this time too, the Lucan Waseri peiod fell, causing a large influx of Lucan refigees from the north.
