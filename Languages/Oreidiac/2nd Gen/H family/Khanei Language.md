# Dialects
The Phabi'i'aha and Hıdhı dialects were inbetweens for the [[Locations/Cities/'Aekha|'Aekha]] and 'Ÿdcicæ dialects, the Hıdhı being closer to the 'Ÿdcicæ, and Phabi'i'aha to 'Ækha.
All these dialects descends from the [[Languages/Oreidiac/2nd Gen/H family/Old Khanei Language|Old Khanei Language]].
## Northern/[[Locations/Cities/'Aekha|'Ækha Dialect]]
The 'Ækhan Dialect is the most distant, splitting off from the very first settlers. It is distinct other dialects as it didn't undergo any of the sound changes other branches did.
It didn't raise its central vowel, retained the /ð̞/, and vowel hiatus, instead of developing glottal stops, it merged the vowels to develop a larger vowel inventory and collapsing them.
## Southern
The southern branch is distinct by undergoing the vowel shift.
### Western-'Odadle
Western dialects are distinguished from Eastern dialects by /ð̞/, instead of becoming /l/, became /ð/. Its only representative is 'Odadle, the capital dialect. 
### Eastern
The Eastern dialects are distinguished by /ð̞/ collapsing with /l/, not /ð/
#### Vÿnei
The Vÿnei underwent to most changes since Old Khanei.
The two forms of voiceless stops merge; and all the grammatical plural endings got lost; alongside many more loanwords from foreign languages, especially from [[Languages/Oreidiac/2nd Gen/C family/Taknitic Harabban|Taknitic Harabban]].
#### 'Ÿdcicæ
The 'Ÿdcicæ was seen as the standard dialect, due to its close connections to the mainland, being the dialect most presented in the article
