## Introduction
Our few islands will speak our words, and we declare, under the 120 gods of these lands, to be known for all time. We have asked our elders for what their elders were told by their elders, the great ancients, hearing stories of when the isle was found, the Dłąxšɂąx Lȳmp was lived in, and Baku ruled over us. We record our greatest of Myths and stories onto this stone, given onto us by the great king Takunuti.
## **I** Creation
The great soul of the world took the first breath, and the first word was said.
The word defined what the world is, not being into the universe, but within and throughout, the language being holy.
