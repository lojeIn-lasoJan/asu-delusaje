**22.1.1. 502-519
*22.1.1.1. Goisi's Early Life
Ğoisi, born Ğöhisamønu, was born in 502 pDa, 19th of Mvodi, being the 6th son of Emperor Iroquwa the Steel and Empress Ejya of Igou. When he was 13, in 515 pDa, he was given the duchy of Paysi in the north east of the Empire, bordering his older brother’s,  Guptan’s land. He saw the greater worth of his brother’s, Beſ, northern lands, and he traded Paysi for Kasortu, which would become Old Ğoisi. In 516 pDa, he discovered many water springs there, and founded six heliang mines, bringing many riches to him, as the land was mostly uninhabited.
In 519 pDa, he invited many refugees from Gant-Eloi, during the civil war. Due to his wealth, he was able to provide locations for the refugees, and he was able to establish himself as a king/theocrat of them. The people, who became known as Pre-Kanic Ğosans. Many sound changes in Bahri Ğosan occurred during then, for example the reduction of most vowels, loss of voicedness distinctions, and loss of open started words.
*22.1.1.2. Start of a Nation
From 530 to 550, a migration of people from South-East Cypronxh into the south, concentrating the urbanising Old Ğoisi, due to its status as a refugee haven, as they were escaping from the expanding Atlasids. They brought a large amount of different genes, and distanced the dialect from the standard Southern dialect, and brought in many foods that would become mainstays of the Ğosan cuisine, such as dried meat sauces and Vaffenmi (melted dragon fat with spices).
During this time period, the many refugees that stayed developed a Ğosan identity, and using the riches of the mines, Ğoisi urbanised them, and due to the pre-existent semi-nomadic, they adopted raised, moveable houses. Ğoisi standardised the houses to be hexagonal houses with 5.6m(3rt) long sides, with three stories, the uppermost one being a communal library/study room, so that in total every book is accessible, due to it being communal; the middle floor being bedrooms of the family. The lowest floor is a kitchen and entrance room, with an entrance at the centre of the floor, as most houses do. The total building is on stilts around 1.4m tall, with wheels, so that it can stay but be moved; called the Kazarim style. This still will be copied and altered by many nomadic agriculturalists, such as a majority of Thyaric cultures, many South Diqiwan and Ghatyean cultures, and Afriqyan cultures.
They also started domesticating and herding semi-domesticated Angel’s Death, becoming Qylyzanyza.
Due to the location of Old Ğoisi, it was, alongside Beſ's lands, used as a buffer state between Gant-Eloi and the Taknitic heartland, and joining both the Gantic and Taknitic alliances in 19th Mvodi, 602, meaning that unlike Beſ, who decided to be thorn in both their sides, Ğoisi allied with them, meaning the two couldn’t attack the other, and the alliances assured the military safety for the Ğosans, the Ğosans focused near exclusively on trading, farming, and scholarship.
*22.1.1.3. The Ten Castes
From 602 to 650 a ten caste system formed, based on three major professions, and their fame and riches. The three professions were ‘WataÞyza’, trader and merchant, ‘Kywyza’, scholar, religious leader and poet, and ‘Tykyza’, commoner and farmer; and the three ranks are high, mid and low, based on riches, merit and fame. This forms nine casts, with one more made based around Ğoisi, who was the king, his family, and the surrounding people, representing a rank above high, and it's the only rank that contains a militaristic force of any kind, as to protect Ğoisi and the court. Many people could move
between castes easily between the professions, or horizontally, like a normal job, and movement between rank, or vertical movement, is more difficult, as it necessitates the earning of fame, riches or merit in government. The castes are ordered and named in a way, to keep record keeping 
easy, each having a number, a name, and colour:
I-Kynytywynyþyza-King and Court
II-WazaWataþyza-Rich and Famous Merchants
III-WazaKywyza-Great and Notorious Scholars and Religious Leaders
IV-WazaTykyza-Fruitful and Rich Farmers and Commonfolk
V-ÞaqywazaWataþyza-Good to do Merchants and Traders
VI-ÞaqywazaKywyza-Middle-Class Scholars, Religious leaders and Teachers
VII-ÞaqywazaTykyza-Average and Common Farmer
VIII-ÞaqyWataþyza-Poorer Trader and Merchant
IX-ÞaqyKywyza-Very Unknown Scholars and Teachers
