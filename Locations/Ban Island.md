==The island of Ban, named after its namesake mythological discoverer, Ban, possibly being inspired off of the commander of the island's discovery, was discovered ~1400 bGc, by South Anatolic sailors. and then some East Anatolic settlers came, creating the unique phenotype. They spoke a South Anatolic language. Thta language was drivven to extinction by the Seda migration from further inland, who migrated from there all the way to Ban, frming the [[Ethnicities/24 Tribes/Banite Tribe]]. they set up a large series of shepherding lordships, which slowly united into a few fiefdoms, which were, 89 bGc, united under a high king under the influence of the Amosi, who didn't kill them, as they were seen as powerful allies, who could gaurd their new colonies. In 6 bGc, before the yearly celebartion of Storms, when every man of Banite clanship returns to Ban, a handful of pirates arrived and shelled parts of the coast. During the celebration itself, the cracks formed widened, and then split open, expunging scalding volatile gases across the whole island. due to the sudden loss in volume across the whole island, a giant earthquake occurred too. Due to the timely arrival of the storms, the volatile gases solidified into large formations of Bakhti, which had special properties, making it Banite stone. The volatile gases continued being expelled over the follwoing few thousand years, via cracks, and every few decades, following earthquakes occurred.== In the autumn of 4870, a giant storm went over Ban, ridding the rest of the volatile fumes, and allowing settlement of the region.
# History
## Before discovery
### Formation
Ban Island was seeming formed by a rise of fluid in the mantle pushing up, with the island having a lot of volatile fluids within the island itself.
### Flora & Fauna
The island had many cliffs, and many low mountains that stretched through the entire island; covered in trees.
## 1st Habitation
### Discovery
Supposedly discovered by Ban, thus the name. Ban was possibly inspired off of the commander of the island's discovery, was discovered ~1400 bGc, by South Anatolic sailors; then some East Anatolic settlers came, creating the unique phenotype. They spoke a South Anatolic language in a majority
### Ṣedite Migration
c. 800 bGc, a few Ṣedite tribes migrated into Ban Island, bringing in [[Languages/Oreidiac/2nd Gen/K family/Proto-Island-Seda|Proto-Island-Seda]], and forming the [[Ethnicities/24 Tribes/Banite Tribe]] killing off the Anatolic banite languages, even though they did contribute a lot of loans.
### Lordship era
The nomadic peoples formed hundreds of small shepherding regions, where major families ruled areas of land, with subservient families living there. Over time, they grew into large sections of land ruled by a family, and having surrounding vassal states. These were called Fiefdoms. By 200 bGc there were 17 fiefdoms.
### Fiefdom era
by 200 bGc, there were 17 fiefdoms. many allied with eachother to form confederacies, and by 100 bGc, 12 of the 15 fiefdoms were in the Kosi Confederation, headed by the fiefdom of Kosi.
### Kingdom Era
During the [[Events/Century of Tribal Collapse|Century of Tribal Collapse]], there was a considerable push to unify Ban by the Amosi, to have a single puppet in the west. Due to that, Ban united under the Fiefdom of Kosi, making the Kingdom of Ban under King Dǫ I, formerly Cheif Geoqḍoe.
They were made to follow ethnically based laws, and been made a vassal state of the Amosi
### Destruction
In the start of 6 pGc, before the yearly celebartion of Storms, when every man of Banite clanship returns to Ban, a handful of pirates arrived and shelled parts of the coast. During the celebration itself, the cracks formed widened, and then split open, expunging scalding volatile gases across the whole island. due to the sudden loss in volume across the whole island, a giant earthquake occurred too. Due to the timely arrival of the storms, the volatile gases solidified into large formations of Bakhti, which had special properties, making it Banite stone.
## Interhabitatus
During the Interhabitatus of Ban, it was covered in Banite stone and a constant haze of volatile gases, with semi-regular earthquakes, as the gases continued to pour out.
