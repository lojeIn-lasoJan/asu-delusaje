The northern regions have it as /q͡χ/ and /χ/; some central dialects use /ħ/, /ʕ/; eastern dialects merged it with /x/ and /ɣ/; and eastern dialects said it as /h/, /ɦ/ further east. the dialects became more similair to western ones over time, eventually losing ȝ completely by the post-genocidal periods, however older communities kept it
