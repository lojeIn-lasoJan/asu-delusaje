# Introduction
The Khanei Tribe <Khanei: /kʰa.nei/, Harabban: /ka.ne.ju/> were a people group that lived in what is now the East Ban Island Chain, being the descendants of the Ilians, and the other Non-Exanatolic Ilians died out. They were relatively small and dispersed among the land for most of their short history. They were considered part of the 24 tribes, being descended from Ondar, and the most secluded of all the tribes
# Origins
The Khanei peoples arrived into the islands around the 6th c. bGc, due to the migration of further South Anatolic tribes into North Anatolia. The Proto-Khanei/Ilians lived in North-East Anatolia, around [[Locations/Cities/Ilia|Ilia]]. The land they came into was a long uninhabited area, which was marshy, wet and forested. The first settlements we small huts on the coastal forests. They spoke the [[Languages/Oreidiac/2nd Gen/H family/Old Khanei Language|Old Khanei Language]], and adopted the new [[Yodo script]].
# Pre-Genocidal History
## Early Migration
==From the 6th c. bGc upto 256 bGc, the Khanei tribe was made of many small chiefdoms, which slowly shrinked in the main islands from hundreds of separate chiefdoms, to dozens, to 6 in the 3rd c. bGc. The one that managed to win over the rest, is the Odadho Kingdom, which beat out the small A'ihadha Chiefdom in 256 bGc, giving the title of [[Positions/Chief of A'iha|Chief of 'A'iha]] to the husband of the king's eldest daughter, and if the king has no  daughters, the oldest closest female relative of the kings.
There were still a a few indipendent cheiftainships out in the far west, where travel and living were difficult, but they were nominally under Odadle
The Odadla Family claimed descent from Ondar, and high priests of [[Locations/Cities/Ilia|Ilia]]==
Between 6th c. bGc and 256 bGc
## Kingdom period
During the time period when Khanei was a united kingdom, heavy urbanisation took place, and many of the rural communities fell. There were 6 major cities, [[Locations/Cities/'Aekha|'Aekha]], Hıdhı, 'Ÿdcicæ, 'Odadle, Phabi'i'aha, and Vÿnēy. there existed small farmign steads around the cities. 'Odadle was the capital.

During this time, they spoke [[Languages/Oreidiac/2nd Gen/H family/Khanei Language|Khanei]]. There were dialectal variations however, despite the cultural homogeneity. The city of [[Locations/Cities/'Aekha|'Aekha]] was famous of the many reddish-brown stones, which were often used. Thusly, the colour was named is surrounding cultures Oka (this is a refernec to Ochre).
# Culture and Religion
The Khanei culture is very unique, and has regional variations to other Anatolic cultures.
For performances of religious stories usually use intricate masks, and large gestures to show. One unique feature is that in Khanei, they speak as little as possible in ceremonies, as it is seen that speaking to someone unprompted is seen as disrespectful, so adressing the spirits in their ceremony unprompted would be disrespectful.
Adress is only made by the priest, who is said to enter a trance, being the house of the gods, Zubadlēa. His speech should be rare though, as he leads the procession of it.
The main deity for Khanei peoples is Dlēaku, the sky god. 
# Genocidal period
During the Pre-Genocidal Period, trade of the major cities to the mainland was mostly cut off, due to external reasons, such as climate, and as the [[Ethnicities/24 Tribes/Amosi Tribe|Amosi]] started to make an empire. They isolated the Khanei tribe, and strated to occupy Vÿnei.
From 105 bGc - 96 bGc, Grand Vizier Megalo documented Khanei culture to a very high extent.
During the time period, Khanei lands were slowly occupied and colonised.
From 97-95 bGc, Khanei peoples were placed into concentration camps a few miles east of Vÿnēy, arranged thusly:![[Photos/topic/Arrangement of Khanei concentration camp.png]]The black/grey squares in 1 are tents (5x5m), with 10 2x1m beds/spaces within.
1 is 15x15m(225m²), with a bare corridor going through. It can have 60 people within; usually with 3 guards stationed within.
2 can have 35 1s, arranged in North-South groups of 7 and 7.5m corridors in between of those groupings; in total 105x105m(11,025m²). It can store 2,100 people, usually one being reserved for military stationing, thus having 2,040 Khanei and 185(80 in the camp, 105 in station) soldiers.
3 shows the whole concentration camp, 8 2s surrounding a central courtyard, in which the rest of the military and food supply was. It was 315x315m(99,225m²)
It stored 16,320 Khanei, more than enough for all Khanei. The inner courtyard also held 1,500+ soldiers within.
